	<p>They were clumped together by the dozen, hanging from the ceiling hibernating.</p>

	<p>Darlene and I went with our friends Caryl and Laura and Laura&#8217;s two sons to Clifty Falls State Park this afternoon in the sultry 22 degree weather for a hike.</p>

	<p>There&#8217;s a century old railroad tunnel at the park. A guy, who was later Governor of Ohio, tried to build a railroad through Madison, but went bankrupt before he managed to get the thing finished. &#8220;Brough&#8217;s Folly&#8221; has left behind a few interesting artifacts including the incomplete tunnel through the canyon bluffs of Clifty Creek.</p>

	<p>The entrance has several underground creeks running nearby so the ceiling of the tunnel was covered with icicle stalactites.</p>

	<p>Somehow we managed to convince the two boys, the oldest of whom is 5, to go through the tunnel. They were a bit scared at first, but I encouraged them by showing them all the fun things in there.</p>

	<p>I held Ben&#8217;s hand while Caryl took younger Alex and we walked them through over the rocks that have fallen over the decades and trying to avoid the standing water on the bottom of the tunnel.</p>

	<p>At one place, the whole ceiling fell out and with our good flashlight you could see a couple dozen feet into the hole above us.</p>

	<p>Then there&#8217;s the underground creek that carved a crevice in the ceiling. There was a waterfall there today and the wall was encrusted with iron deposits. That was cool, but showing them the big spiders in the crevice evenly spaced every six inches was &#8220;Cool!!&#8221;</p>

	<p>Ben wanted to turn back, but I encouraged him to go just a little further so he could see my favorite part of the tunnel in the winter. He grudingly agreed.</p>

	<p>Fortunately, soon we were able to see either side of the tunnel and that encouraged him.</p>

	<p>We got about halfway when we found them, probably 100 or so bats hibernating in clumps of 4 to 40 bats each.</p>

	<p>Ben&#8217;s first reaction was &#8220;aargh! bats!&#8221; But I shined my light at them and showed him how they were furry with cat-like ears. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t they cute Ben?&#8221; &#8220;Awww, yeah&#8230;&#8221;</p>

	<p>He then took the flashlight and searched the ceiling and walls for more. &#8220;There&#8217;s some and there some.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Boy, it&#8217;s fun when you can get a kid whose scared of something and turn them into a big fan. &#8220;Boy this is fun!&#8221; I helped him climb over huge boulders on the other side. He was a real trooper.</p>

	<p>Their mom is due with the third brother in April, so we promised that we&#8217;d take the boys playing some more this spring.</p>

	<p><b>Whenever I think of bats (rated PG-13 parental discretion is advised).</b></p>

	<p>I had a blast, but whenever I think of bats, I can&#8217;t help to think about the book &#8220;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve never read the book, but an old friend once did a radio show where he played &#8220;road trip music&#8221; and between tunes read from books about road trips. He read a passage where the main characters are having to cover some sort of event in Las Vegas, but en route decided to go to LA and buy huge quantities of drugs and take them all en route to LV. After a ungodly dose of ether, the protagonist (if you want to call him that) starts to hallucinate.</p>

	<p><blockquote>&#8220;We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold. I remember saying something like &#8220;I feel a bit lightheaded; maybe you should drive &#8230;&#8221; And suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats, all swooping and screeching and diving around the car, which was going about a hundred miles an hour with the top down to Las Vegas. And a voice was screaming: &#8220;Holy Jesus! What are these goddam animals?&#8221;</p>
 Then it was quiet again. My attorney had taken his shirt off and was pouring beer on his chest, to facitate the the tanning process. &#8220;What the hell are you yelling about?&#8221; he muttered, staring up at the sun with his eyes closed and covered with wraparound Spanish sunglasses. &#8220;Never mind&#8221;, I said. &#8220;It&#8217;s your turn to drive.&#8221;I hit the brakes and aimed the Great Red Shark toward the shoulder of the highway. No point mentioning those bats, I thought. The poor bastard will see them soon enough.</blockquote>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1217.html" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
