<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/928.html" title="The DaVinci Code"> The DaVinci Code</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>I finally read The Da Vinci Code during vacation after everyone and their brother told me to read it. After that kind of buzz I expected a lot so on the whole I came away a little disappointed.</p>

	<p>The concepts and history interpretations he presented were rather interesting and I loved the puzzles. Yet, as literature it wasn&#8217;t very good.</p>

	<p>It read like a mystery novel wrapped around an academic paper. It used the &#8220;cliffhanger&#8221; device way too often, author Dan Brown didn&#8217;t realistically develop the characters and the dialog seemed to exist solely as a way to convey information about his research. Overall it came off as bit sloppy to me.</p>

	<p>I started reading it while we were at the Leeper Park Art Fair in South Bend. An English teacher came up and said it was one of her 10 favorite books of all time, but that she was mad at the author because she was a Christian.</p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t know why an English teacher would consider it one of her top 10, but I&#8217;m not surprised it made her mad. Unfortunately, the conversation ended before it really got started so I&#8217;m not sure what part of the book made her mad&#8212;Jesus as human, the &#8220;edited&#8221; Bible, how the early church adapted and pilaged the existing religions, goddess worship, etc., etc. I guess any could do the trick.</p>

	<p>It didn&#8217;t really make me &#8220;mad&#8221; per se. I think part of the reason is I never took the Bible as absolute truth (though it does contain absolute truths). Like Brown, I suspect that books like the Bible don&#8217;t make it through time unedited. Recent translations have made true efforts to return to the earliest copies, but where are other reports of Jesus&#8217; life? Just as Fox News bypasses news of President Bush&#8217;s foibles, I suspect we&#8217;re missing details of Jusus&#8217; truly astounding life.</p>

	<p>That&#8217;s the end of my thoughts as of now. I&#8217;m still thinking.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>To even things up, here&#8217;s some forgotten Buffalo to go with the forgotten New York.</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.buffalohistoryworks.com">Buffalo History Works</a> is a really neat history site about my home town.</p>

	<p>Buffalo is really a pretty amazing town with nice architecture, funky shopping, great eating and some world-class museums. However, it&#8217;s also lost a lot during the era of &#8220;urban renewal.&#8221;</p>

	<p>While there are a couple Frank Lloyd Wright Homes still standing in Buffalo such as the newly renovated <a href="http://www.darwinmartinhouse.org">Darwin Martin House</a>, the <a href="http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Larkin_Building.html">Larkin Building</a> <a href="http://www.pbs.org/flw/buildings/larkin/larkin.html">(more)</a> was lost.</p>

	<p>I remember seeing pictures of turn of the century Buffalo that had downtown streets lined with magificent buildings that are now all gone.</p>

	<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, there are still some really cool edifices&#8212;such as the shot from movie &#8220;Bruce Almighty&#8221; where Jim Carrey is standing atop a Buffalo skyscrapper. We also have an awesome <a href="http://ah.bfn.org/a/church/28/guar.html">Louis Sullivan building</a>. Check out the <a href="http://ah.bfn.org/a/bamname.html">Buffalo as an Architectural Museum</a> webpage.</p>

	<p>Another gem that&#8217;s all but lost is Buffalo&#8217;s <a href="http://www.buffalohistoryworks.com/terminal/Welcome.html">Central Terminal</a> that served as the main railroad station for several decades. It was beautiful, but it&#8217;s now rather decayed&#8212;though still beautiful. This website is on of my favorites. It&#8217;s <a href="http://www.buffalohistoryworks.com/terminal/youare/here.html">haunting</a>.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>In the past 20 years, the Republicans have brilliantly developed the method &#8220;framing&#8221; issues to steer voters in their favor. It&#8217;s not much different from a reporter asking a &#8220;leading question.&#8221; You bias a question with the intent of getting a specific answer.</p>

	<p>While this can be a legitimate means of campaigning, it also results in a slew of misinformation or misdirection from the truth.</p>

	<p>In addition to the CJR&#8217;s Campaign Desk, The Annnenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania has started a new website called <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/">FactCheck.org</a> that aims to peer through this fog.</p>

	<p>I haven&#8217;t read through the whole site, but it appears to blow up the urban myths of campaigns. For example was Bush a &#8220;deserter&#8221; as Michael Moore claims? Was Wesley Clark a Republican? What Bush left unsaid in the State of the Union Address.</p>

	<p>They also have an email service to receive the updates as soon as they&#8217;re published.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>Sheyl Crow is one of those singers where I either love or hate the song.</p>

	<p>Her tunes fall into two catagories, the sad &#8220;I&#8217;m a broken woman&#8221; sorts and the &#8220;I&#8217;m in southern Cal soaking up the sun when everyone else in the world is broken and crazy.&#8221; I guess those are the kinds of tunes her voice can manage.</p>

	<p>In general it is the later that are my favorites. &#8220;Soak Up the Sun&#8221; and &#8220;Everyday is a Winding Road&#8221; are some of the best road tunes of the decade.</p>

	<p>The rest&#8230; well there&#8217;s 17 tunes and I&#8217;d have dumped five of them off the CD. Nonetheless, I bought the CD for the library collection. Grade: B.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s frustrating. When there are thousands of CDs issued every year, sometimes buying greatest hits packages is the only way to get a good sampling in the collection.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p><b>&#8220;The Love Bug&#8221;</b><br />
Darlene and I have recently watched several classic Disney flicks including &#8220;The Absent Minded Professor&#8221; and &#8220;The Shaggy Dog&#8221;. Good stuff actually. The Love Bug mixed a good dose of automotive philosphy with 60s humor yet it never seemed forced. Buddy Hackett was great and Dean Jones was perfect as a person who was &#8220;half a man&#8221; if he wasn&#8217;t racing cars.</p>

	<p><b>&#8220;Charade&#8221;</b><br />
Cary Grant and Audry Hepburn star in this thriller where you are not quite sure if Grant is a good guy or murderer, yet the two get along famously. Lots of romantic wit and suspense. Great date movie. Grade A- as Hepburn&#8217;s a bit too sappy at times.</p>

	<p><b>New on DVD</b><br />
Two movies that just came out in video/DVD that are really good. &#8220;Finding Nemo&#8221; and &#8220;Bend It Like Beckham.&#8221; </p>

  	<p><b>Jimmy Buffett</b> &#8220;Meet Me in Margaritaville.&#8221;</p>

	<p>This is Buffett&#8217;s latest greatest hits package. There are a few good tunes I had not heard and a few mildly disappointing live versions of favorites. I liked &#8220;Feeding Frenzy&#8221; better. B-</p>

	<p><b>The Mighty Lemon Drops</b> &#8220;World Without End&#8221;</p>

	<p>A late 80s British band. The first half is pretty good punk pop. The second half is a bit slow. The tune &#8220;Inside Out&#8221; is great. B-</p>

	<p><b>Dave Brubeck Quartet</b> &#8220;Time Out&#8221;</p>

	<p>Here&#8217;s an oldie but goodie jazz album I listened to as a kid and have rediscovered. The album&#8217;s lead piece &#8220;Blue Rondo A La Turk&#8221; is even better than &#8220;Take Five&#8221; which became a hit. Later in an interview, Dave Brubeck said &#8220;Take Five&#8221; was never intended to be more than a wonderful, albeit glorified, drum solo. Grade A-</p>
