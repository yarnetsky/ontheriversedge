<h6>{Read}</h6>		

<ul>
<li><b>Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators</b>: When I was a kid, this was my favorite series of mysteries. I found one at a bookstore once and have been collecting them since. They're a lot of fun, good solid fluff reading now, but definitely a good read for 3-5 graders it features three California boys who together formed an investigation agency that tackles the craziest mysteries featuring things from singing serpents and crooked cats to screaming clocks and dancing devils. The mysteries are puzzles, but fair-- a sharp kid can solve them along with first investigator Jupiter Jones. I love their business card. It features three question marks ??? “The question mark is the universal symbol of something unknown. We are prepared to solve any puzzle, riddle, mystery, enigma, or conundrum which may be brought to us,” Jupiter Jones explains in the first book. As a reference assistant and someone who loves to encourage kids to read, these guys are my heroes.</li>
</ul>


<h6>{Listen}</h6>	

<ul>
<li><b>Jimmy Buffett</b> "Meet Me in Margaritaville." This is Buffett's latest greatest hits package. There are a few good tunes I had not heard and a few mildly disappointing live versions of favorites. I liked "Feeding Frenzy" better. B-</li>
<li><b>The Mighty Lemon Drops</b> "World Without End" A late 80s British band. The first half is pretty good punk pop. The second half is a bit slow. The tune "Inside Out" is great. B-</li>
<li><b>Dave Bruback Quartet</b> "Time Out" an oldie but goodie jazz album I listened to as a kid and have rediscovered. The album's lead piece "Blue Rondo A La Turk" is even better than "Take Five" which became a hit. Grade A-</li>
</ul>


<h6>{Watch}</h6>	

<ul>
<li>"<b>The Love Bug</b>" Darlene and I have recently watched several classic Disney flicks including "The Absent Minded Professor" and "The Shaggy Dog". Good stuff actually. The Love Bug mixed a good dose of automotive philosphy with 60s humor yet it never seemed forced. Buddy Hackett was great and Dean Jones was perfect as a person who was "half a man" if he wasn't racing cars.</li>
<li>"<b>Charade</b>": Cary Grant and Audry Hepburn star in this thriller where you are not quite sure if Grant is a good guy or murderer, yet the two get along famously. Lots of romantic wit and suspense. Great date movie. Grade A- as Hepburn's a bit too sappy at times.</li>
<li>Two movies that just came out in video/DVD that are really good. "<a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0266543/"><b>Finding Nemo</b></a>" and "<a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0286499/"><b>Bend It Like Beckham</b></a>."

     <h2>Thanksgiving Day Football<a name="106999330006641960">&nbsp;</a></h2>
		<div class="blogPost">
          We had Thanksgiving Dinner at Darlene's younger sister's house tonight. Nearly the whole family showed up (about 30). I played made up games with the neices and nephews and ate plenty of good food. This year's home grown turkey came in at 41 pounds.<br /><br />It's not a Thanksgiving, however, unless we get to play football.<br /><br />We played what Devin (a high school football player) calls Farm Football-- Out in the pasture with cow patties to make things interesting (as well as plenty of puddles from today's constant rain). My team couldn't catch the ball, but we managed a good running game and won 3 to 2. The last two touchdowns came at the onset of darkness. We used the darkness to run sneaky plays-- they had no idea who had the ball until it was too late.<br /><br />Mind you, the flavor of the game came from the two llamas at the 20 yard line and the cow in the end zone.<br /><br />Happy Thanksgiving family and friends<br />

		<div class="blogPost">
          It's 1 a.m. and we just got home from playing euchre and <a href="http://www.mattelgames.com/uno/flash_index.asp">UNO</a> with our friends for the last five hours. Boy what a wild time.<br /><br />For those who play UNO, here's a great house rule we were introduced to tonight.<br /><br />When a draw two or draw four is played, the next player can match it and so can the next. The player who can't match it is stuck with picking up the draws for all the matching cards. <br />Tonight we had four draw twos in a row so the fifth player had to pick up eight cards.<br /><br />Darlene and I played draw fours so the next player picked up eight and then and I picked a color that forced the player after that to pick another eight cards because she couldn't match the color.<br /><br />It's a pretty mean rule, but boy was it fun.<br />

		<div class="blogPost">
          A few days ago I was wondering what the scoop was with this warm weather. I guess it was just Mother Nature's way of either a) giving us one last hurrah or b) spoiling us and then yanking it away hard.<br /><br />I think it'd depend on whether you were a half-cup full or empty sort. For those not paying attention we hit the 70s this weekend and here's what's around the corner....<br /><br />Tonight: Snow possible after 5am. Occasional rain. Low near 34. Winds SW between 18-20 mph, with gusts as high as 40 mph. <br /> <br /> Monday: Snow possible until 11am. Mostly cloudy, then gradually becoming mostly sunny, with a high around 36. <br /> <br /> Monday Night: Clear, with a low around 21. Wind chill values as low as 15. <br /><br />So... after 70s is this "a" or "b"???<br />

     <h2>Wild weekend<a name="106956459978883323">&nbsp;</a></h2>
		<div class="blogPost">
          The birthday party (prior post) capped a wild weekend. It was surprising considering the quiet week.<br /><br /><b>On the frustrating side,</b> I've been working on a four-page 11x15 brochure for the local historic preservation organization. It's going to look rather nice. I'll post a pdf of it when I get a chance. However, the information I received from the printer the first time didn't quite match what they told me the second time. As a result I hit a brick wall. <br /><br />The first time they simply gave me measurements, the second time they said they had a template they preferred I use-- they're not the same. Similarly, the first time I was supposed to convert the document to a pdf, the second time they said just send the original document. That also meant I needed to change the fonts I was using (in hind sight I could have guessed as much). Unfortunately, I did not have those fonts and had to bug a friend for copies to use on the project.<br /><br />It's back on track, but I lost a weekend of time.<br /><br /><b>Meanwhile</b>, our friend the tinsmith calls to have me bring by some of his work (we're selling his tinware from our studio) and two bottles of wine to his house ASAP. <br /><br />He said he hit paydirt at match.com and found a date from Cincinnati-- a cute 47-year-old who believes in syncronicity. All week apparently she had been humming a certain song about the tinman from "The Wizard of Oz" and then meets a "tinman" on match.com. <br /><br />They chatted online for four hours that night and he was smitten. She agreed to come down to Madison-- thus the wine.<br /><br />He called the next day to say they sat up talking until 5:30 the next morning. That's all I know because our phone battery went dead. I'm sure I'll hear about it sometime.<br /><br /><b>Nice long hike</b>. Having given up on reaching the tinman (he was probably off on his next phone call) we went out an hiked at Clifty Falls for a couple of hours. The park is so different after the leaves fall. The trails are trickier as the roots and rocks are covered in leaves. However, you can see all the way from the rock outcroppings down to Clifty Creek and to the far side of the canyon. The views are simply unavailable from March-October.<br /><br />The effects of the rock concert are finally wearing off so maybe I can sleep.<br />

     <h2>My heart's still beating in 6/8 time<a name="106956278219892262">&nbsp;</a></h2>
		<div class="blogPost">
          We now know what an 18-year-old's birthday party is like. <br /><br />Often adults get invited to such parties to keep the parents company, but we were invited by the 18-year-old himself who has kind of adopted us as honorary aunt and uncle (though the parents were glad to have company nonetheless).<br /><br />We showed up late and missed most of the parlor games. Then again, that may have been a good thing. We did catch the tail end of one game where everyone kneels in a circle passing around a playing card... with their lips.<br />You hold the card up to your mouth and suck in air to hold the card to your lips and try to pass it to the next person who in turn tries to suck the card to their lips. I overheard the rules stipulate if you dropped the card you had to kiss that person. I did not, however, witness this in practice.<br /><br />However, we did show up in time for the rock concert. Carl, the birthday boy, plays bass in a band with a few friends and they played a short set of pretty decent punk rock at full throttle in the living room. The floors vibrated as did my rib cage. The concert was capped by a Jimi Hendrix-style rendition of "Happy Birthday" with everyone screaming the lyrics.<br /><br />Then there was the entertaining black and white cat. One guy was wearing pants about six inches to long and ripped at the foot. The cat would follow his feet and pounce on his pants. Later, Darlene took a breather from the concert to find the cat on the dining room table eating the birthday cheese cake.<br /><br />Entertaining indeed.<br />

          The library due date stamp is telling me December is less than two weeks off. The holiday shopping season is right around the corner.

Darlene's mother has already asked us what we want for Christmas. <br /><br />Yet, it's 64 degrees outside and it's supposed to get upto 70 by Sunday. <br /><br />What's wrong with this picture?<br />

		<div class="blogPost">
          As winter approaches, I thought y'all would appreciate this study:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/11/031106051159.htm">ScienceDaily News Release: Hot Cocoa Tops Red Wine And Tea In Antioxidants; May Be Healthier Choice</a>: <br /><br />"Using special analytical techniques to evaluate the total antioxidant content in each beverage, the researchers showed that, on a per serving basis, the antioxidant concentration in cocoa was the highest: It was almost 2 times stronger than red wine, 2-3 times stronger than green tea, and 4-5 times stronger than that of black tea.<br /><br />For those who want the tasty treat but also want to avoid extra sugar and dairy products that are common additives to cocoa, healthier alternatives are possible: Skim or soy milk can substitute for regular milk, while an artificial sweetener can replace the sugar. <br /><br />Although you can enjoy cocoa either hot or cold, the hot version tends to trigger the release of more antioxidants than its cold counterpart, the researcher says.

		<div class="blogPost">
          The downtown is slowly getting into the mood for Christmas. All the lightposts and the Broadway Fountain are wrapped in yellow lights and bows. The merchants have redesigned their store windows.<br /><br />There was an open house downtown Friday night to kick off the holiday season, but only a few people managed to find their way down to Darlene's studio. Earlier in the evening their didn't appear to be much of a crowd, but I heard there were more people later.<br /><br />Instead, I went to take tickets and sell concessions for the local theater group. They had three one-act plays-- the first was performed by the kids troupe, the second by 20- and 30- somethings and the third for the senior set. Good stuff.<br /><br />Other than that, Darlene and I mostly worked. I'm still trying to finish the print project, but I'm getting close. More and more pots are slowly coming out of the kilns as a result we may try to get a fourth outlet before Christmas.<br />

          Darlene came up to bed after checking her kiln for the last time tonight sniffing a handful of her hair. "I must remember to put my hair up when the kiln is on," she said.<br /><br />She was leaning over next to the kiln and strands of her hair ended up going in a peep hole (a hole in the kiln that accordingly allows you to "peep" in). The kiln being over 1000 degrees, you can guess what happened.<br />

          Everyone down here in the historic district is anxious as the date to pay property taxes is fast approaching. Our taxes went up about 30 percent, but many of our friends had their property taxes double and triple as a result of the state switching to "market value" property assessment.<br /><br />The Indiana House Ways and Means Committee <a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/localnews/2003/11/13in/wir-front-itax1113-8039.html">held hearings</a> here in Madison yesterday to see how the change is impacting historic communities. A larger than usual number of properties are for sale down here as people are wanting to get out of the taxes.<br /><br />As Benjamin Franklin said on this date in 1789-- "In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes."<br />

		<div class="blogPost">
          I attended the annual meeting of the Indiana Visual-Audio Network today. I was appointed to it's overall board of directors by our library board (all member libraries get to appoint a member). <br /><br />It's no big deal really. The only chore is to attend an annual meeting to brainstorm and rubberstamp some of the stuff the executive committee drafts such as the annual budget.<br /><br />We had a nice lunch, I won an audio book as a door prize (darn-didn't get the DVD player) and did a tour of the brand new (and extremely impressive) Indianapolis Star printing plant.<br /><br />During the brainstorming session I opened my mouth a couple of times and later when they were trying to fill a vacancy on the executive committee, one of the directors said "Hey Jerry, why don't you do it."<br /><br />Would my director let me? will they pay me or is this volunteer? errrr---let me think about this. The past-president later pulled me aside to half-begged me to try it. I'll talk to my boss tomorrow. It'd be one day a month committment. It wouldn't be bad at all if I were within an hour of Indy, but four hours of driving for two hours of meeting is a bear. What's the phrase--make a suggestion and you volunteered?<br /><br />For what it's worth IVAN is a state authorized library cooperative to circulate multimedia packages to member libraries (i.e.--we get a package of 40 videos for eight weeks and then ship them to the next library and get a fresh set of 40 videos. It's a nice for smaller libraries).<br />

          The doctor's appointment was mostly harmless. <br /><br />Indeed, the doctor and I spent most of our time talking about politics and health care policy. He's a guy about my age, so it's interesting getting his perspective. <br /><br />Either way, I'll have one mole that's only a little suspicious removed. Normally, he'd ignore it, but with the history of my dad and previous moles coming back suspect,we'll quickly snatch off anything that looks odd. Thus I suspect I may be knifed regularly for years to come.<br />

		<div class="blogPost">
          The last time I went in for a skin cancer screening, they took off several moles. I'm not a fan of needles or knives in any fashion, but I braved through two rounds of slicing and stitches (pretty good for someone who used to scream bloody murder at the site of a needle when I was a kid and would turn blue at the thought as a teen). Thank God for local anestetic.<br /><br />The doctor told me to show up every six months and of course it is now six months.<br />Darlene started bugging me about it at 5.5 months and I told her not to bug me until November as that's six months. So she kept her word and didn't bug me until the first week of November. Being the adult I now am, I kept my word and immediately called to make an appointment.<br /><br />I said any day, whatever's convenient for the doctor. She picked today at 11. <br /><br />Now the good Lord has been working in mysterious ways of late, dropping hints about life, the universe and everything about everywhere I've been looking. I wonder if he's at it again as 11-11 was my Dad's birthday who in turn died of cancer. hmmmm.....<br />

I got up and sure enough there was a man walking a goat down Jefferson street.  I know this is a rural area but ...!  What will be next?"<br />

A $300 overhaul may not be that bad -- if one has $300 :)<br /><br />Mind you the Apple Store is great. It's like being in a store where they actually understand you.

I didn't think of that..."<br /><br />She told me that she hesitated to say the obvious, but hey a librarian is there to serve the patron. I hope she marked that down as a reference question.<br />

He said it was literally in the street sitting in a parking space.<br /><br />It's hard to say if we're being teased or if this really happened.

     <h2>The day ended well<a name="106809225057874435">&nbsp;</a></h2>
		<div class="blogPost">
          The weather indeed got cooler, but it is still within the pleasent fall weather range so far. This weekend I may not say the same as it won't get out of the 40s.<br /><br />For better or worse, I've come to somewhat dread Wednesday evenings in the children's room. I really enjoy helping the kids and parents find books and info, but I just don't get enough of it. Instead it's more like shelving books in the dungeon. It wouldn't be so bad if there was someone around, but it gets a little too quiet and lonely down there. I guess I'm too much of a people person.<br /><br />The number of children's programs has been consistantly growing and with that the number of books flying out of the library is growing. Accordingly, the number of books to shelve gets larger as well. Actually, the library in general has been getting much busier, if the amount of shelving we're having to constantly do is an indication, our circulation is up. It'll be interesting to see the October stats that should be coming out any day now.<br /><br />Either way, I got back to the library only to face two huge carts of books-- no I didn't get them all shelved. No one showed up to see the movie ("African Queen"- another movie I'd love to see on the big screen) and the children's room was again quiet.<br /><br />I did get to show a mother how to set up a blog for her kid. She was hoping to get her son into a writing workshop we're holding, but one of the volunteers didn't show so we had to cut the registration off early. Instead, I suggested the son create a blog as it's certainly cooler than keeping a diary or journal. I figure getting any writing out of him would be a start. She liked the idea and will see how it goes.<br /><br />That was the sole question on the night until Darlene surprised me at 8:40 and kept me company and helped me shelve books the last few minutes. We then slowly walked home in the autumn air and had a nice conversation punctuated by the kind of hugs on Main Street that has people calling us "those silly love birds." Maybe not, but you get the idea. <br />

Safety pins for a zipper simply does not feel safe.<br /><br />

		<div class="blogPost">
          When websites first became hot. I realized that I'd be left behind if I didn't learn the code. I succeeded, but prefered using a program that would write the code for me--Freeway for Macintosh.<br /><br />However, lately most of my clients have been wanting to update their sites more often than I have time to serve them. I guess that's the downside of taking too many clients when you're moonlighting.<br /><br />As a solution I'm started writing custom blogs they could update on their own. Unfortunately, the blog templates were all written in a different language. So here I am again, learning a new language from scratch.<br /><br />Cascading Style Sheets are easy enough to understand on the face of it all, but I'm still trying to figure out why one combination of code works and another doesn't. It'd probably help if I just got a book. You wouldn't know I worked in a library.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I've been spending hours playing with this site. Which, as several of you can tell, is a good chunk different from yesterday. <br /><br />Am I:<br /><br />a) being an incorrible geek? <br /><br />b) procrastinating on a paying print project that isn't working the way I want it to?<br /><br />c) procrastinating relearning math, algebra and geometry in preparation for the Graduate Record Exam?<br /><br />d) all the above and much much more.<br />

		<div class="blogPost">
          This <a href="http://www.metaphy.com/Rays/rays4.html#anchor297845">article</a> contemplating an owner's manual for life is a little metaphysical for my tastes, but it hits on something I've often wondered. Wouldn't it be cool if everyone came with a user's manual? Then we'd have fewer disagreements and would be more fulfilled.<br /><br />Maybe, maybe not. It would certainly undermine the enjoyment of learning about someone. Then again, I never read the instructions for a computer program unless I have to. But knowing it's there helps immensely.<br /><br />Thus, if your fellow human is constantly bombing and giving you the "blue screen of death." Wouldn't it be nice to pull out their manual to help with the diagnostics and provide tips to avoid the situation in the future?<br /><br />OK, mine might look like this...<br /><br /><b>Troubleshooting guide:</b><br />If-- human's main processor starts fuzzing out.<br />Sign of -- dehydration and/or lack of fuel to the brain.<br />Solution -- a glass of water and/or a little food.<br /><br /><b>Maintenance schedule:</b><br />Regular maintenance is required for this human. To insure continued optimal operation, do the following.<br />*Hugs at both regular and irregular intervals. Does not need excuses.<br />*Feed every 5 hours. Water every 2 hours.<br />*Take for road trip at least once every 21 rotations of the earth.<br /><br />At a loss for thoughts-- my main processor is indeed fuzzy and the solution is on the burner --I asked Darlene what else would be in my manual.<br /><br />She grinned.<br /><br />"Rated G please."<br /><br />"Okay, I guess that about covers it."<br /><br />Hmm, I must be easy.<br />
