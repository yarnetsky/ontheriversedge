<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>I don&#8217;t think I have EVER done that much homework in such a short time. I was told summer sessions were intense, but I never expected this.</p>

	<p>In the last week of my class I gave a 7-minute presentation, wrote a 6-page report, a 10-page journal, a group project on budgeting and evaluations of my teammates and myself. I did classwork from Friday-Monday basically non-stop.</p>

	<p>Nonetheless I survived and I&#8217;m on vacation until Monday.</p>

	<p>Even though I&#8217;m exhausted, I was suffering cabin fever and my mom is in town so we took off and partied a little in Louisville&#8212;Carmichael&#8217;s Books, Half-Price Books and a really cook new pottery gallery/supply shop at 1806 Frankfort Ave. With that break I now feel like I&#8217;m done.</p>

	<p>We&#8217;ll hang out around town for a couple of days and then take off for Chicago for the American Library Association annual conference on Saturday. We&#8217;re planning on going to &#8220;The Stacks&#8221; the exhibition portion of the conference which I hear is quite an experience. I&#8217;m looking forward to visiting the new Graphic Novel section as I&#8217;m definitely a comics addict (I think I&#8217;m up to 65 strips a day&#8212;a hard habit it is).</p>

	<p>Wow&#8230; vacation. I might even have time to blog.</p>

  	<p>I finally got my official grades and I got a pair of As to start off my grad school career.</p>

	<p>When I first started thinking about grad school everyone told me I&#8217;d do fine. Yet when I read the grading scale I admit I was intimidated. I knew I&#8217;d get better than a B, but I never imagined As. I guess I need to stop underestimating myself. ey?</p>

	<p><blockquote><br />
A (4.0)         Outstanding achievement.  Student performance demonstrates full command of the course materials and evidences a high level of originality and/or creativity that far surpasses course expectations.  The grade of A+ is not granted in SLIS, except in very exceptional cases.</p>

	<p>A- (3.7)        Excellent achievement.  Student performance demonstrates thorough knowledge of course materials and exceeds course expectations by completing all requirements in a superior manner.</p>

	<p>B+ (3.3.)      Very good work.  Student performance demonstrates above-average comprehension of the course materials and exceeds course expectations on all tasks as defined in the course syllabus.</p>

	<p>B (3.0)         Good work. Student performance meets designated course expectations, demonstrates understanding of the course materials, and performs at an acceptable level.<br />

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>We&#8217;ll as of 3:30 p.m. today I was done with the first semester of grad school. Six credits down, 30 credits to go. I turned in my two final projects. I think I did a good job on them.</p>

	<p>When I left my last class, I almost would have gone as far as saying I&#8217;m not sure what I&#8217;d do with myself not having homework hanging over my head for the next two weeks.</p>

	<p>Actually, I&#8217;ll have plenty on my agenda.</p>

	<p>This weekend and next my wonderful &#8220;muddy&#8221; wife is having her pottery studio spring open house. Check the details over at <a href="http://www.mudcatpottery.com">Mudcat Pottery</a>. Yes, I used the same template I created for this website. That may be one of the things I do over break is get some new stuff up on her site and tweak it to give it more of its own personality. I also hope to read a novel or two. There are a couple new mysteries by William Tapply and Tim Cockey I&#8217;ve shelved in the new book section that I&#8217;d love to get my hands on. Maybe add a movie or two and some Star Trek.</p>

	<p>Of course, our building needs a good cleaning from top to bottom&#8212;I have a month worth of junk on my bedside table that I really need to go through.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ll finally also have time to play with my computer a bit. My copy of Mac OS X 10.4 &#8220;Tiger&#8221; arrived in the mail this afternoon and I&#8217;m backing up all the files from my computer as I type. I&#8217;ll install it tomorrow and see if it is as good as people are reporting. There is a rather interesting review on the operating system over at <a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/macosx-10.4.ars">ArsTechnica</a> that delves into every technical detail you could imagine.</p>

	<p>Finally, I read the headlines that our state government finally approved Daylight Saving Time for 2006. Now we move the battle to whether we&#8217;ll be in Eastern or Central time. I&#8217;m hoping we&#8217;ll get to stay in Eastern time, at least in our neck of the woods as I would really hate having it get dark at 4 p.m. in the middle of winter.</p>

	<p>That&#8217;s all the news for Friday, 29 April 2005 (except that the movie version of &#8220;Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy&#8221; finally opened). Don&#8217;t Panic.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>Well, I just finished my mid-term exam in collection development and my body is buzzing. I had forgotten what it&#8217;s like to come off of an adrenaline high.</p>

	<p>I think I did pretty well on it. Our prof drew a graph on the board of what she expected. Along the top was short and long. On the side was airy and dense. Short and airy, as long as it answered the questions, gets a B. Short and long, odds are you end up with a few details in there, gets a B+. Short and dense with details gets an A- and long and dense with details gets an A. I think I&#8217;m on the dense side (pun intended).</p>

	<p>I&#8217;d have to agree with a classmate of mine. This is our only test in the class and it&#8217;s for 33% of the grade. All the assignments we&#8217;ve done so far this semester only equal 25% of the grade. Too many eggs in one basket there.</p>

	<p>The semester is now on the downhill side, we&#8217;ve learned all the basics and adding the details. The key will be getting all the homework done.</p>

	<p>As soon as I catch up with myself here, Darlene and I will drive straight to Lima, Ohio, to spend Easter with her family. While Darlene and her sister are filling plastic eggs for the annual Easter egg hunt, I&#8217;ll go hide in the living room and do homework. But as soon as the kids show up, I&#8217;ll be in the thick of it.</p>

	<p>Happy Easter. To celebrate the day I want to remember what Jesus actually asked us to do in the world&#8212;as a friend of mine said yesterday &#8220;Jesus broke the bread and fish and fed the thousands. He didn&#8217;t sell them.&#8221; Unfortunately, that seems to be fighting words these days.</p>

  	<p>My collection development professor wasn&#8217;t planning on writing many comments on a draft document we turned in last Friday&#8230; that was until she saw an &#8220;it&#8217;s&#8221; that should have been an &#8220;its.&#8221; Seeing that the &#8220;dam broke loose,&#8221; she said, and the comments were flowing. Of course, yours truly had to be one of the offenders.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m surprised that you, having been a journalist, would make that error.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;What can I say, I had copy editors.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Between you and me, I&#8217;m amazed my writing has been as clean as it has been lately.</p>

	<p>It wasn&#8217;t a beautiful afternoon, but it certainly wasn&#8217;t the cold, windy Fridays of recent weeks. Thus I went for a walk and, for the first time ever, visited the Indiana State Library and the Indiana Capitol.</p>

	<p>Both buildings have been recently renovated and both are absolutely beautiful and do the state proud.</p>

	<p>I walked around the capitol extensively peering in at the Indiana Supreme Court and the house and senate chambers. I stood in the office where former Madison Mayor Morris Wooden sat as state auditor. I even visited the governor&#8217;s office.</p>

	<p>I knew the governor wasn&#8217;t there. Indeed, he was here in Madison while I was there in Indianapolis.</p>

	<p>Nonetheless I gave the person at the desk in his office my three cents.</p>

	<p>Penny one: The governor comparing the minority Democrats, who had walked out on the legislative session, to terrorists &#8220;car-bombing&#8221; his &#8220;drive toward reform&#8221; was pretty darn tacky when our troops are in Iraq suffering from the real &#8220;car bombs.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Penny two: I noted that complaining about it was hypocritical when the Republicans had done the same type things to Democratic administrations. As a classmate of mine stated: &#8220;same practices, just the sides have changed.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Penny three: I did say that I liked the idea of daylight savings time.</p>

	<p>See I can be bi-partisan.</p>

  	<p><b>Friday was a good day on campus.</b> We finally had a sunny afternoon. Not a cloud in the sky so I took advantage of my lunch break to go for a nice long walk down to the White River and back talking to Darlene on the cell phone until my shoulders got sore (I should have locked my backpack in the library lockers). The campus is pretty barren now, but I&#8217;m starting to see the trees. It should be rather pretty come spring.</p>

	<p><b>grades</b>: I finally received my first graded assignments back in both classes. It felt really, really good to see &#8220;excellent work&#8221; and &#8220;outstanding&#8221; on my first papers.</p>

	<p>I have to admit that the concept of graduate school had terrified me. Last summer while I was studying for the GRE, a librarian I know said &#8220;Jerry, it&#8217;s just library school, you&#8217;ll be fine.&#8221; OK, now that I&#8217;m doing the work I can agree with the statement.</p>

	<p><b>Coursework</b>: In cataloging we are moving on to MARC records. I thought I was drowning in rules before. Now I&#8217;m really drowning in rules. It&#8217;ll click in I&#8217;m sure.</p>

	<p>In collection development we are building a collection development plan and related policies step by step. Those policies should reflect the library and the community it serves. Thus the first step is to create a fictional library and community&#8212;fictional, though connected to reality. This is the fun part. I remember covering the Talawanda schools in Oxford, Ohio, when I worked as a reporter for the public radio station at Miami University. You have the college profs wanting a high-end education for their kids, but the farmers outside of town were paying the lion&#8217;s share of the property taxes. They definitely butted heads a bit during board meetings. So&#8230;how would a library operate in similar circumstances? Thus my fictional library will echo that dicotomy.</p>

	<p><b>Speaking of fictional</b>: It amazes me that we still haven&#8217;t screamed bloody murder that the White House has systematically created propoganda for domestic consumption. The fake newscasts played as real news, the columnists paid to write &#8220;real&#8221; opinion, federal agencies hawking political agenda and now &#8220;Jeff Gannon&#8221; a fake reporter asking fake questions in White House press conferences so real reporters are being thrown off track. If this was the Clinton White House the Republicans would have set up five investigations by now. Sheesh. Propoganda simply has no place in our society. If the president has something to say, let him say it loud and clear and be answerable to the press and the public. They are pushing fear and hiding behind fake newstories. It&#8217;s unethical at best.</p>

	<p>grrrrrr [imagine a dog taking the Bush action figure by the collar of his flight suit and shaking it back and forth]</p>

	<p><b>From the mouths of kids</b>: There is a six-year-old patron of ours that floors me. I told him about the Danny Dunn series of books, which was one of my favorites at his age. He&#8217;s been swallowing them whole and sent me a thank you note. A THANK YOU NOTE without as much as a word from his parents. Amazing. Now he won&#8217;t let anyone else check out his books if I&#8217;m on the desk. The last time he checked out a video and some books. The due date on the video was Feb. 23 and the books were due on March 2 so I told him about how the numbers were opposite 2-3 and 3-2. He backed up as in shock and said &#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s a palindrome!&#8221; A six-year-old knows what a palindrome is? I can understand him knowing the Latin names for all the dinosaurs but palindromes too?</p>
