	<p>Reading about the darkening picture in Iraq, I am convinced that a change of leadership is an absolute neccesity.</p>

	<p>The atrocities in the prison camps are absolutely beyond imagination and absolutely inexcusable.</p>

	<p>Here are two articles <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&#38;cid=518&#38;u=/ap/20040505/ap_on_re_eu/britain_iraq_us_prisoner_abuse&#38;printer=1">from the AP</a> and from the UK&#8217;s <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1211374,00.html">Guardian</a> newspaper.</p>

	<p>We&#8217;re better than this folks and the only way we can prove that to the world (let alone the Iraqis) is to not only to punish those soldiers and contractors responsible, but to fire the administration.</p>

	<p>We&#8217;ve lost all credibility as a country that cares about the Iraqi people and it comes at a time when we need to win their &#8220;hearts and minds&#8221; the most.</p>

	<p>Bringing in a new administration would tell the world we still want to fight terrorism, but that we also respect the world in the process.</p>

	<p>How did all this happen?</p>

	<p>It appears that Bush has no control whatsoever over this situation.</p>

	<p>For example, it appears the president didn&#8217;t even learn of the photos depicting the atrocities from his own personnel. He saw them on television.</p>

	<p>The prisons are not even run by the military but by hired contractors seemingly above military law. The contractors in turn are hiring workers with no experience whatsoever to do high level intelligence work.</p>

	<p>The Internetional Red Cross meanwhile has been <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/07/politics/07RIGH.html">complaining to senior officials</a> about the attrocities for months.</p>

	<p>While on Arab television Bush didn&#8217;t even have the heart to apologize for the troops and contractors ultimately under his command. He&#8217;s the commander in chief. The buck stops with him. I&#8217;m glad he has finally started by apologizing to the Jordanian monarch, but he&#8217;s not an Iraqi.</p>

	<p>The bottom line is he started a war without a plan for occupying the country and now he&#8217;s suffering the consequences. These are just the symptoms of the disease.</p>

	<p>There are good reasons for being in Iraq and in the long run things will be better for the Iraqi people.</p>

	<p>But the timing was bad (we still don&#8217;t have Osama Bin Laden) and the implementation has been even worse.</p>

	<p>As former owner of the Texas Rangers, Bush understands that when your starting pitcher is being bombed, you pull him if you have any desire to win the game.</p>

	<p>If there&#8217;s any hope for &#8220;winning&#8221; this war. If there&#8217;s any hope of gaining the confidence of Iraqis. If there&#8217;s any hope of gaining the cooperation in the world-wide war on terrorism, it&#8217;s time to go to the bullpen.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" href="http://www.ontheriversedge.com/index.php?id=1217" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
