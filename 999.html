	<p>My mom wrote that she was too cynical to believe that Kerry could win. I wish I were that cynical. It would be a lot easier to take the loss.</p>

	<p>Darlene and I are starting to recover from the shock. We&#8217;re alternating as to which of us is depressed and which of us is angry as hell.</p>

	<p>I kept thinking all the bad news would catch up with Bush. I kept thinking people would realize Kerry&#8217;s immense value to our country. I underestimated how little people pay attention to the elections. I&#8217;m amazed how much people will put up with to have a candidate they agreed with.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m astounded at how truly awful the media was over the past year. There were so many issues and statements that needed analyzing and all they could do was talk about Cheney&#8217;s daughter. Now Bush is talking about restructuring Social Security and our tax laws. The press barely mentioned these so-called priorities during the election.</p>

	<p>Similarly, I wonder if they&#8217;ll report on the true disaster Ohio and Florida has become. I&#8217;m not one to believe in conspiracies, but it is hard to swallow results when voters receive ballots pre-punched with Bush (if they punch Kerry the ballot is tossed as spoiled). It&#8217;s hard to swallow when a machine gives Bush 4,000 more votes than are registered at the precinct. It&#8217;s hard to swallow when 58,000 absentee ballots disappear. Way too many instances to believe fraud did not take place.</p>

	<p>My father-in-law who lives in western Ohio said he saw no reason to vote when the election would get stolen anyway. I convinced him to vote anyway, but somehow I suspect it may be hard to get him to vote again.</p>

	<p>As I look to the future I wonder how one combats against a party that submerges you in a swamp of lies and then screams we&#8217;re playing dirty politics when we tell the public we&#8217;re being drown. I wonder how one combats against a party that has mastered the art of fog and deceit. Mastered voter fraud and voter disenfranchisement in a way not seen since Jim Crow.</p>

	<p>But most of all, please don&#8217;t get me going about morality and politics.</p>

	<p>On occasion, however, I&#8217;ve been able to pull back and look at how far we&#8217;ve managed to come. In theory we should have been defeated by the biggest landslide in history. Instead, 49 percent of the country said they did not want Bush as president.</p>

	<p>Basically we&#8217;re media starved and we need to work on how we explain our core values to the public. Beyond that I believe a good chunk of the infrastructure is in place for future victories. We have excellent fund raising and a GOTV machines. Even in Congress, we should have lost more than we did. We lost only four seats when the Republicans figured they&#8217;d gain seven seats in Texas alone. We also performed well at the state level gaining six legislatures. For example, Democrats rule the Colorado legislature for the first time in 50 years. We just have to keep pushing.</p>

	<p>Second terms are messy and the Bush administration has shown no talent so far at getting themselves out of the muck, so here&#8217;s to looking at 2006.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;m going to see if I can get registered for spring classes. I&#8217;m looking at L520 Bibliographic Access and Control and L528 Collection Development.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1217.html" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
