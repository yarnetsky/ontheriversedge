	<p>Our building was once a hotel in the 1870s-80s. For three days it seemed to be a hotel again as Darlene&#8217;s sister and 7 of her 8 kids came to visit for three days.</p>

	<p>It was a blast. They all had a turn on Darlene&#8217;s pottery wheel. We took them to see Harry Potter at our 1930s movie theatre here in town. Spent a day swimming at our WPA pool.</p>

	<p>Yesterday we took them to the Louisville Zoo. Their new butterfly exhibit is pretty impressive. I love the blue morphos. <a href="http://www.louisvillezoo.com/news/events/butterflies.htm">&#8220;Thousands of flights daily&#8221;</a> through Sept. 30.</p>

	<p>Finally we took them canoeing at a nearby lake today before they headed home.</p>

	<p>Two of gang accidentally tipped their canoe. They both shifted the same direction at the same time. ooops.</p>

	<p>Seeing them go over I entered &#8220;protective uncle&#8221; mode and went to the rescue. Actually, I amazed myself by remembering how to right a flooded canoe in deep water from a single canoe. I read about it years ago and had never done it before, but it worked.</p>

	<p>They were laughing and having fun. In a way I wish I had let them enjoy it a little more. Instead I ordered them around a bit so I could get them out of the water and save the canoe.</p>

	<p>Everyone seemed to have a fun vacation either way. It was great to see them. They&#8217;re growing so fast.</p>

	<p>Finally, I got a new wireless router. Boy the thing was a royal pain to set up. It&#8217;s why I hate PCs. Apple routers are simple in comparison, but they&#8217;re between models for another few weeks so I bought a cheapy to hold me over. In the end I gave up and called tech support. But at least I&#8217;m up and running again.</p>

	<p><b>Update:</b> Thinking back over the mini-vacation with the kids, one of my favorite times was during the credits of &#8220;Harry Potter.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Our friend was the manager that night and she told us we could go up on stage and play in the light. So I went up with all the kids and we all shadow boxed, danced and generally made fools of ourselves. Never in my life has that opportunity presented itself and boy did we take advantage of it.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1217.html" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
