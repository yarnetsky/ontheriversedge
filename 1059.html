	<p><b>Friday was a good day on campus.</b> We finally had a sunny afternoon. Not a cloud in the sky so I took advantage of my lunch break to go for a nice long walk down to the White River and back talking to Darlene on the cell phone until my shoulders got sore (I should have locked my backpack in the library lockers). The campus is pretty barren now, but I&#8217;m starting to see the trees. It should be rather pretty come spring.</p>

	<p><b>grades</b>: I finally received my first graded assignments back in both classes. It felt really, really good to see &#8220;excellent work&#8221; and &#8220;outstanding&#8221; on my first papers.</p>

	<p>I have to admit that the concept of graduate school had terrified me. Last summer while I was studying for the GRE, a librarian I know said &#8220;Jerry, it&#8217;s just library school, you&#8217;ll be fine.&#8221; OK, now that I&#8217;m doing the work I can agree with the statement.</p>

	<p><b>Coursework</b>: In cataloging we are moving on to MARC records. I thought I was drowning in rules before. Now I&#8217;m really drowning in rules. It&#8217;ll click in I&#8217;m sure.</p>

	<p>In collection development we are building a collection development plan and related policies step by step. Those policies should reflect the library and the community it serves. Thus the first step is to create a fictional library and community&#8212;fictional, though connected to reality. This is the fun part. I remember covering the Talawanda schools in Oxford, Ohio, when I worked as a reporter for the public radio station at Miami University. You have the college profs wanting a high-end education for their kids, but the farmers outside of town were paying the lion&#8217;s share of the property taxes. They definitely butted heads a bit during board meetings. So&#8230;how would a library operate in similar circumstances? Thus my fictional library will echo that dicotomy.</p>

	<p><b>Speaking of fictional</b>: It amazes me that we still haven&#8217;t screamed bloody murder that the White House has systematically created propoganda for domestic consumption. The fake newscasts played as real news, the columnists paid to write &#8220;real&#8221; opinion, federal agencies hawking political agenda and now &#8220;Jeff Gannon&#8221; a fake reporter asking fake questions in White House press conferences so real reporters are being thrown off track. If this was the Clinton White House the Republicans would have set up five investigations by now. Sheesh. Propoganda simply has no place in our society. If the president has something to say, let him say it loud and clear and be answerable to the press and the public. They are pushing fear and hiding behind fake newstories. It&#8217;s unethical at best.</p>

	<p>grrrrrr [imagine a dog taking the Bush action figure by the collar of his flight suit and shaking it back and forth]</p>

	<p><b>From the mouths of kids</b>: There is a six-year-old patron of ours that floors me. I told him about the Danny Dunn series of books, which was one of my favorites at his age. He&#8217;s been swallowing them whole and sent me a thank you note. A THANK YOU NOTE without as much as a word from his parents. Amazing. Now he won&#8217;t let anyone else check out his books if I&#8217;m on the desk. The last time he checked out a video and some books. The due date on the video was Feb. 23 and the books were due on March 2 so I told him about how the numbers were opposite 2-3 and 3-2. He backed up as in shock and said &#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s a palindrome!&#8221; A six-year-old knows what a palindrome is? I can understand him knowing the Latin names for all the dinosaurs but palindromes too?</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1217.html" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
