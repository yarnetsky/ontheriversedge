	<p>This photo was taken yesterday. I had a feeling the guy was tone-deaf, but this is beyond the pale. He needs to be seen with  Governor Blanco in a helicopter examining reality, not playing around with some country star. sheesh. (via <a href="http://www.dailykos.com">DailyKos</a>)</p>

<strong>Update</strong>: apparently he did finally decide to come to Washington today and flew over the gulf coast on his way.

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>OK, now the Bush administration wants to exploit national park lands for the benefit of industry. </p>

	<p>The Department of Interior is reviewing the National Park Service rules and wants to alter the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-na-parks26aug26,0,1127124,full.story">service&#8217;s primary mission</a>  (LA Times):</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8220;They are changing the whole nature of who we are and what we have been,&#8221; said J.T. Reynolds, superintendent of Death Valley National Park. &#8220;I hope the public understands that this is a threat to their heritage. It threatens the past, the present and the future. It&#8217;s painful to see this.&#8221;</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>You need to read the article. The potential changes would liberalize rules that prohibited mining and take away managers&#8217; ability to use laws such as the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act to oppose new developments in parks.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>According to current policies, when park officials determine an activity may lead to impairment, officials are authorized to ban the activity. The proposed changes would alter the definition of impairment from &#8220;an impact to any park resource or value [that] may constitute an impairment&#8221; to one that can be proved to &#8220;permanently and irreversibly adversely [affect] a resource or value.&#8221; Critics say the new definition would set a standard that is impossibly high.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>The proposed rules would also liberalize light and noise regulations in the parks that would kill the night sky and peace and quiet for wildlife and park-goers alike. You could expect low-flying tour planes and snowmobiling in all parks. Oh yes, and cell towers too. </p>

	<p>Allegedly, these proposed changes were intended to be concepts for the purpose of debate and are no longer in play. Yet a park service supervisor participating in the review rejected the assertion.</p>

	<p>I believe government has a strong role in promoting industry and commerce, but giving away (or even selling) rights to <strong>OUR</strong> rare landscapes is going too far! We just gave energy companies billions of our tax dollars, now they&#8217;re wanting to give mining companies our national parks? Talk about corporate welfare.</p>

	<p> The bottom line is that I just don&#8217;t trust these guys anymore.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>It&#8217;s a realization slow in coming, but in my mind, the biggest threat to our nation isn&#8217;t terrorism, but rather oil.</p>

	<p>Our entire economy is fueled by cheap oil. Urban sprawl and our current housing bubble is fueled by cheap gas (&#8220;sure I can commute 60 miles to work each day&#8221;). The cheap prices at Wal-mart is enabled by cheap transportation of cheap products from China. When cost of oil goes up, the cost of everything will eventually follow.</p>

	<p>Our foreign policy is motivated by oil. Why else would we be coddling terrorist nations like Saudi Arabia? Why else would Pat Robertson be talking in <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/08/25/news/notes.php">frustration</a> over the notion of assinating Venezuala president Hugo Chavez? Venezuela is an oil rich country with a president that refuses to sell out.</p>

	<p>Our government is motivated by the oil companies. Why else would we give billions and billions of dollars in tax benefits to the most profitable companies in the history of the world?</p>

	<p>Hoosier political writer <a href="http://www.howeypolitics.com/">Brian Howey</a> states the problems well in <a href="http://www.decaturdailydemocrat.com/articles/2005/08/23/news/opinion/editorial01.txt">his latest column</a></p>

	<p>I have no idea when we&#8217;ll hit &#8220;peak oil.&#8221; Some scientists are saying oil producers won&#8217;t be able to keep up with demand within the decade. Oil companies are saying the date is closer to 30 to 40 years away. With China and India&#8217;s growing energy needs, I&#8217;d tend toward sooner than later. Either prediction leaves little time to wean these companies off their profits.</p>

	<p>I have no problem with profits, even hugue profits. I love it when my favorite companies have a profitable quarter. However, there should be some responsibility to the human race and that&#8217;s where my frustration peaks.</p>

	<p>My problem is that many of our leaders refuse to talk and plan for a post-oil economy. Even conservation would help a load, but we won&#8217;t see even minimal fuel standard improvements in SUVs until 2011. Even then we&#8217;re talking about <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/bus/stories/DN-fuelrules_24bus.ART.Collin_County.Edition2.139575fc.html">saving only a gallon a week</a> per vehicle.</p>

	<p>We seriously need a shift in how we talk about energy, how we use energy, how we think about energy. If we don&#8217;t at least talk about the future reality we&#8217;ll be on the slippery downslope driving a top heavy SUV with bald tires.</p>

	<p>Yet hidden in the news I&#8217;m finding at least a few people talking about things. Democratic Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer is evangelizing a <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20050825/pl_nm/energy_montana_dc">method of converting coal to gasoline</a>, diesel and aviation fuel. Just with the deposits of coal in his state alone, Schweitzer figures Montana could power the nation&#8217;s vehicles for 40 years. A barrel of this stuff is estimated to cost $32 as opposed to $65+ for oil.</p>

	<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer-Tropsch_process">Fischer-Tropsch</a> technology would obviously great for coal states, but it&#8217;s still not a renewable fuel source. However it is a step in the right direction because the stuff runs cleaner, it would be American fuel and it could possibly lend us some energy freedom that we desperately need right about now. </p>

	<p>Think about it&#8230;wouldn&#8217;t it be nice to deal with terrorists without worrying whether their sponsors would cut off our fuel supply.</p>

<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/index.html?id=1109" title="Bush &#8220;shifting&#8221; on Plame blame? Try &#8220;shafting&#8221;..."> Bush &#8220;shifting&#8221; on Plame blame? Try &#8220;shafting&#8221;...</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>OK now, on June 10, 2004, President Bush was asked if he would fire anyone who had anything to do with the leaking Valerie Plame-Wilson&#8217;s name as a covert CIA agent. Bush responded &#8220;yes&#8221; and his spokeman since repeated the statement to the White House press corps.</p>

	<p>How come today, he is suddenly &#8220;shifting&#8221; his position as USA Today put it?<br />
Now  he&#8217;ll <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-07-18-bush-rove_x.htm">&#8220;if someone committed a <b><i>crime</i></b>, they will no longer work in my administration.&#8221;</a></p>

	<p>To me that essentially says he <b><i>knows</i></b> someone (or someones) in his administration most definitely messed with Plame, but he doesn&#8217;t want to do a damn thing about it.</p>

	<p>Striking out at Plame because her husband discredited the Bush rally cry to war would be playground petty if she were not with the CIA. However, she was an agent and to me that borders on treason.</p>

	<p>Why? Consider this question&#8230; if Plame is outted as a covert agent, isn&#8217;t that in turn going to out anyone who covertly worked with her?</p>

	<p>This isn&#8217;t the only thing about his statement today that drives me bats&#8212;how about the notion that he&#8217;s known about the allegation for two years and says he &#8220;doesn&#8217;t know all the facts.&#8221; For that to be true he must have told everyone involved to keep him in the dark so he wouldn&#8217;t have to testify.</p>

	<p>If there&#8217;s any saving grace its that the White House press corps finally has a string to pull. They suddenly seem to realize they&#8217;ve been lied to and are trying to unravel the mess we&#8217;re in. Mind you, the odds of that happening are still pretty slim, but you can&#8217;t blame a cat for dreaming.</p>
