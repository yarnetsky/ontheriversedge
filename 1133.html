<div class="entrytext">

	<p>As you scroll down tonight, you&#8217;ll notice I&#8217;m in a bloggy mood. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve written six posts in two days in the past eight months that I&#8217;ve been in grad school. </p>

	<p>It think it is because tonight is my last night of freedom. My &#8220;Information Architecture for the Web&#8221; class starts tomorrow and &#8220;Information Sources and Services&#8221; class convenes on Saturday.</p>

	<p>On one hand, these classes might be a little easier than my first four classes as I have some experience in both. Even so I need to come away from both classes with more advanced skills.</p>

	<p>On the other hand, I&#8217;m just not ready to jump back into the fray. </p>

	<p>When I talked to people about getting an <acronym title="Master of Library Science">MLS</acronym>, they all said essentially the same thing&#8212;getting the degree is like running a marathon&#8212;you just have to keep going and until you cross the finish line you won&#8217;t have a life.</p>

	<p>Mind you, I think the analogy faulters a bit when you take summer sessions. That&#8217;s like inserting a 400 meter dash between the marathons.</p>

	<p>Yet, they told me it was doable. Now into my third semester, I&#8217;d have to agree. It&#8217;s doable and I&#8217;m doing it. But I&#8217;ll also admit to whining more than my fair share. </p>

	<p>Oddly, I think the breaks are the worst. They let you breathe just long enough that when it comes time to get back into the groove you feel like you&#8217;re running the race in snowshoes&#8212;you just can&#8217;t get going again. Fortunately, deadlines are definite motivators.</p>

	<p>All that said, I know I have little basis for whining. A friend of mine who I used to work with has six kids and is working on her undergraduate and plans on getting her graduate degree. She would have reason to whine. A classmate at IU is working on her MLS while having teens at home. She told me she has stayed up late many a night after running the kids around to their various practices and events her eyes turning to glaze at 11 p.m. She has reason to whine.</p>

	<p>Me? Nah. I just have a wife who is constantly tempting me to blow of my homework and play (oops&#8230; that was my undergraduate years&#8212;we couldn&#8217;t wait to get married).</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1217.html" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
