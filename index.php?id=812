	<p>Between two botched wars, pork barrel giveaways that&#8217;d make the Democrats blush, and regressive labor and environmental policies, the Bush administration and Congress is getting me growly.</p>

	<p>That alone would be one thing, but then they get hypocritical and moan about little things.</p>

	<p>Take this past weekend for example.</p>

	<p>Sen. John Kerry finally did something in his campaign that wasn&#8217;t stilted. For months, he&#8217;s been stymied by the question of why he voted for the Iraq War. In a Rolling Stone interview, he finally gave an answer that made sense and didn&#8217;t hem and haw.</p>

	<p>Mind you, it may be too late for him. Former Vt. Gov. Howard Dean is running a campaign unlike any witnessed before and he appears to be on a roll. He&#8217;s 30 points up in the latest New Hampshire polls.</p>

	<p>Here&#8217;s what happened (according to an AP article):</p>

	<p><blockquote><br />
WASHINGTON (AP&#8212;Dec.  7) &#8211; In an interview in the latest Rolling Stone magazine, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry used profane language to assess President Bush&#8217;s Iraq policy, and Bush&#8217;s chief of staff said Sunday the Democratic presidential candidate was out of line.</p>

	<p>When asked in the interview about the success of rival candidate Howard Dean, whose anti-war message has resounded with supporters, Kerry responded: &#8220;When I voted for the war, I voted for what I thought was best for the country. Did I expect Howard Dean to go off to the left and say, &#8216;I&#8217;m against everything?&#8217; Sure. Did I expect George Bush to f*** it up as badly as he did? I don&#8217;t think anybody did.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The expletive drew a rebuke from White House, which suggested an apology might be in order.</p>

	<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s beneath John Kerry,&#8221; the president&#8217;s chief of staff, Andrew Card, said on CNN.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very disappointed that he would use that kind of language,&#8221; Card said. &#8220;I&#8217;m hoping that he&#8217;s apologizing at least to himself, because that&#8217;s not the John Kerry that I know.&#8221;</p>

	<p>The Kerry campaign said the Massachusetts senator had no regrets.</p>

	<p>&#8220;John Kerry saw combat up close, and he doesn&#8217;t mince words when it comes to politicians who put ideological recklessness ahead of American troops,&#8221; said spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter. &#8220;I think the American people would rather Card and the rest of the White House staff spend more time on fixing Bush&#8217;s flawed policy in Iraq than on Senator Kerry&#8217;s language.&#8221;<br />
</blockquote></p>

	<p>The whole thing is funny really because Bush has used the very same language. I did a search on the net on came up with these examples which were from newspaper articles and columns:</p>

	<p>Bush told Condi Rice &#8220;F*** Saddam, we&#8217;re taking him out.&#8221;</p>

	<p>In front of his own daughters Bush told Wall Street Journal Washington Bureau Chief Al Hunt: &#8220;You no good f**<strong>ng son of a bitch. I will never f</strong>**ing forget what you wrote.&#8221;?</p>

	<p>At a &#8216;99 fundraiser candidate Bush said his goal as President would be to &#8220;reverse all the f**<strong>ups of the Clinton administration and then f</strong>** the Democrats over.&#8221;? This was in front of the press.</p>

	<p>Bush 5, Kerry 1. Draw your own conclusions.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" href="http://www.ontheriversedge.com/index.php?id=1217" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>
