	<h3>"Knowledge for Sale: Why American libraries are in trouble"</h3>
	
	<p>[<b>Updated</b>: Utne street librarian Chris Dodge today sent me the links to the articles. Also minor edits]</p>

<p>The July/August issue of Utne magazine features an article by "street librarian" Chris Dodge entitled "Knowledge for sale: Why American libraries are in trouble."</p>

<p>If you want to know what the left thinks about libraries, I consider this a must read article. <a href="http://www.utne.com/magazine/newsstand/utne130_knowledge-for-sale.pdf">Knowledge for Sale</a> (also <a href="http://www.utne.com/magazine/newsstand/utne130_monastic-librarians.pdf">Monastic Librarians</a>). From an academic standpoint, there's not a ton of depth, but it's very interesting nonetheless.</p>

<p>He hit on some interesting issues, some of which I struggle with myself at my library-- specifically issues on purchasing and cataloging. I agree with him on both issues. Here are his thoughts and my thoughts...</p>

<p>On purchasing... </p>

<p>If we continue to move toward the demand-model of material selection and/or outsourse the selection process, Dodge argues the collections will become skewed to the popular and mass appeal. As a result, we ignore the minority communities or minority interests. I wholeheartedly agree, though I think people have come to expect the demand model from libraries. </p>

<p>At our library I do some AV purchasing and subscribed to the Film Movement series from Recorded Books. I like it because we now have same access to award-winning films in little ol' Madison as the hot shots in New York and LA. It's a total of 12 DVDs a year, not a large number considering I order at least 180 DVDs a year. </p>

<p>While a number of people have told me they liked the series, one person wrote in our annual survey (paraphased) "stop buying all that foreign junk."  After some thought I concluded the problem wasn't one of an an imbalanced collection, but rather all the popular titles I've purchased are constantly in circulation so you have to show up at exactly the right time (or put them on hold) to snag them. As a result, the collection certainly looks skewed to the obtuse. I think I'll create a paper catalog of DVD titles as people rarely bother to search the catalog to see if we have a title.</p>

<p>On Cataloging... </p>

<p>Dodge also wrote how our standardized catalog systems are unintuitive, severely hampering access to materials.</p>

<p>Having taken "bibliographic access and control" I certainly understand the need for standardization. Obviously, a catalog without controlled vocabulary and name/subject authority is obviously chaos.</p>

<p>However, I'd definitely consider myself a Sandynista. Dodge wrote about the work of Hennepin County (minn.) cataloger Sandy Berman who, through extensive bibliographic record notes and alternative titles and subjects, created a catalog that was very user friendly. Unfortunately, in the name of standardization, the library system reversed his work after he retired. I think that's a sickening shame. </p>

<p>We have a generally easy to use online catalog (Sirsi iBistro), but it is severely lacking in that is has no capabilities to share sees/see alsos. Thus the only way to get around this is to do a Berman-style bibliographic record. (although it'd obviously be better for Sirsi and other search engines to get their act together).</p>

<p>Similarly, authors have to be types in "last name, first name" yet there are no obvious "tips" on the page to tell anyone that.  A person can go away thinking we have absolutely no books on a topic of interest.</p>

<p>Similarly, our library is now in the process of starting a second digital library. On the first I argued we needed alternative catagories as noone will type in dwellings when they are searching for photos of "Madison homes." I was overruled by a very experienced and very wise cataloger who stressed we needed to stick with standards. I am grateful to her as starting off on the right foot and doing the project "right" has helped us get a federal grant to do a second digital library. </p>

<p>This new project is one of the first in the Indiana Digital Library project that aims to create digital projects that can be shared so they can be "harvested" by search engines. Standardization is a must for this to work, yet the problem of "will a person search using LC subject terms?" still exists. </p>

<p>A number of us agreed at a workshop sponsored by the Indiana State Library that we needed to include alternative subjects in addition to official "LC" subject terms. </p>

<p>This whole debate obviously opens a whole can of worms, but I think it's one that needs to be opened. Fried worms anyone?</p>

<p>Here are two links...</p>

<p><a href="http://madison-jeffco.cdm.oclc.org">The Lemen Collection</a></p>

<p>This is the first digital library the Madison-Jefferson County Public Library did. I was in charge of the tech side of the project, scanning and customizing the web templates to fit our desires.</p>

<p><a href="http://openstacks.net/os/archives/000732.html#000732">Open Stacks #1</a></p>

<p>This is the first podcast of Open Stacks by my friend Greg Schwartz. His premiere episode delves deeply into Adam Mathes' paper on folksonomies. If you're interested in cataloging I think you'd find the podcast (an mp3 audio file) to be fascinating.</p>

	<h3>Otter, take 2</h3>
	
	<p>I must admit, I really enjoy otters. When I visit the zoo, otters are by and far the most enjoyable animals to observe. The Cinci Zoo has a decent-sized pond habitat for the otters. The one side is a glass wall that allows you to look underwater while they swim around. They also reintroduced the river otter to Jefferson County a couple years ago up at the Big Oaks National Wildlife Refuge.</p>

<p>So when, maybe six months ago, I saw a kids magazine go across the circ desk with otters on them, the silly pun "otter you be reading?" popped into my head.</p>

<p>Now in SLIS528 Collection Development and Management, I have to create a fictional library. I decided to have an otter as the library mascot and put the drawing on the letterhead. </p>

<p>Our most recent assignment is an intellectual freedom statement along with procedures for dealing with book challenges. The creature is also on my "materials reconsideration form." Who knows, either the otter will help defuse an argument over a book (ahh...isn't he cute?) or the person will find the drawing so darn silly that they'll try to take my head off as well as trying to take the book out of the collection. </p>

<p>My first draft, a couple entries below, looks more like a bear than an otter, so here is my second draft of the drawing...</p>

	<h3>Harry Potter book covers</h3>
	
	<p>Little by little the anticipation is cranked up another level.</p>

<p>Linked are pictures of the three covers for "Harry Pottery and the Half-Blood Prince." Bloomsbury publishes the book in Britain and the commonwealth. Scholastic published J.K. Rowling's books in the United State.</p>

<p>I like the Scholastic version the best, though I admit it may be that I'm simply partial to the color green.</p>

	<h3>Wireless at the library</h3>
	
	<p>The pieces for our library's wireless puzzle are finally coming together. We had our wireless gateway and one of four access points installed on Sunday. Wednesday night some more will be installed.</p>

<p>I spent all day Sunday and most of today working out the bugs and a few more remain. The building's wiring leaves something to be desired as we have to put some of our staff computers on the gateway as well as the wireless and public machines (grumble, grumble). </p>

<p>As a result, we have to log all those machines into the system every morning to get Internet on those machines. It's either that or each user has to log in and lord forbid if they should accidentally log themselves out by closing a pop-up "logout window".  The director doesn't seem to feel this will be a big deal, but I'm waiting for the wails of pain.</p>

<p>Yet, the system is rather advanced. Login is actually pretty easy. When you first try to go to a website, our server takes you to a login page where we get to explain the rules and tell you who sponsors the service. From there you go to our library website and then you are free to surf. People will even be able to roam the library with a laptop and not have to log into each access point. I think it'll be a pretty slick system once it's all in place. Stop by in a week or so for a surf-- it should be on fro 7 a.m.-9:30 p.m. daily.</p>

	<h3>Unshelved</h3>
	
	<p>Darlene had ordered me the latest collection of Unshelved comic strips for my birthday, but it didn't show up. </p>

<p>So she emailed Bill Barnes (half of the team that creates the daily strip) and asked about the delivery. He wrote back that the payment hadn't been received and that it'll ship when it's received.</p>

<p>Then a little later he wrote back, apologizing profusely. The envelope ended up with his personal mail instead of the business mail and (like all of us) hadn't gone through it.</p>

<p>Today he sent another email that the book was in the mail and that for goofing they tossed in a free baseball cap! Darlene was just glad to hear the check didn't get lost and they kick in a free gift.</p>

<p>Library folks are classy folks, it just goes to show.</p>

<p>Send the guys a little love and subscribe to the comic strip, put a link on your website and/or buy some of the fun stuff they have in their store (I have a library raid t-shirt). If you work in a library or love libraries, it's a fun read.</p>

	<h3>Snow Day</h3>
	
	<p>Well, I went in for my noon to 9 p.m. shift and they were talking about closing early at 5 p.m. Then after lunch the director said, forget this, we're closing at 2 p.m. So two hours and 15 minutes into my shift, I was home again. </p>

<p>Depending on road conditions, they'll probably be closed again tomorrow. We're scheduled to be closed on Christmas Eve and Christmas. It will indeed be interesting on Sunday when I return. I suspect there will be a mountain of books to check in.</p>

<p>As noted the National Weather Service was talking seven inches of snow. Now they're talking 15 inches here in our little rivertown. At this pace, I wonder if we'll manage to get out of here Friday to visit family for the holidays. It shouldn't be too bad as it'll stop snowing tomorrow. By Friday afternoon the roads should be OK, but we'll check road conditions first.</p>

<p>We're trying to figure out what to do with our newfound time. I should probably clean our apartment, but the urge to take a nap is also alluring.</p>

<p>A snow plow just came around the corner. Darlene, looking out the window... "Oooh, even the snowplows are skidding. Please don't hit our van." It didn't.</p>

<p>It's still snowing and life goes on.</p>

	<h3>Review: The Librarian</h3>
	
	<p>Sometimes a movie gets so hyped or has so many expectations that it is absolutely ruined. Yet, if you don't take them seriously they can still be a lot of fun. </p>

<p>Topping that list was Twister. The first time I saw it, I found myself repeatedly taking it apart. A year later our old downtown theatre reopened after a multi-year closure and Twister was the grand opening film. We went to help the new owners celebrate. That night was wonderful, a) because the Ohio Theatre is wonderful, but b) because I realized Twister was a funny movie. The line "I've got to go, we've got cows" will stay forever etched in my mind.</p>

<p>Well, when we heard TNT was produce an action-adventure flick called "The Librarian" everyone at our library was excited. Though I admit, most of my cohorts were interested because it starred Noah Wyle. </p>

<p>Now I haven't watched television (with occasional exceptions) for about a dozen years. We live in a 400-foot hole and we don't have cable. Thus everyone saw it before I did. People said it was cheesy, they complained the protagonist wasn't really a librarian. Heck, he never looked up an answer. </p>

<p>So, when our director brought in a video from the premier and offered me first dibs, I went into with low expectations. </p>

<p>Thank God I did because as a result I really enjoyed the movie. When you lower the bar, you can enjoy it for what it is-- a recreation of the grade-B movies. You know... The Killer Tomato that Ate Madison and their ilk. Darlene and I laughed the whole time. It was aweful, but in such a delicious fashion. Heck, I want to watch a sequel.</p>

<p>Heck, and any protagonist that can say, "but Mom, being a librarian is a pretty cool job," can't be all bad.</p>

<p>If you want to catch <a href="http://www.tnt.tv/Title/View4/0,5878,543783|5929||||~~~,00.html">The LIbrarian: Quest for the Spear</a> you can watch it on TNT tonight @ 11:45pm(ET), Sunday, Dec. 12th @ 11:45pm, Saturday, Dec. 18th @ 2pm and Sunday, Dece. 19th @ 10am.</p>

<p>Now I need to pass the video on to the next person in the library.</p>

	<h3>In French, Chat. Chapeau.</h3>
	
	<p>I was in the back hall waiting for my cue. The sounds from the library auditorium echoed of sqeals and laughter. If it wasn't so happy sounding, I'd wonder if a riot was taking place.</p>

<p>"Lord, help me out here." I beseeched as I wondered what I got myself into. I had volunteered to be the Cat in the Hat for a Cat in the Hat Party.</p>

<p>I had taken photos of a Clifford party where "Clifford" interacted with 20 or so kids. I can deal with that. As the party date approached, I learned they had signed up 40 kids.</p>

<p>When I walked into the auditorium, there were no 40 kids there. The place was absolutely packed. "Hmmm, I'm supposed to read Cat in the Hat to this crowd?"</p>

<p>We played it just like the book. The librarian had to go get some craft materials so "the mom" wasn't home when the cat arrived. I came in promising fun. We did "The Cat Says" did a Conga line and a pair of Thing One and Thing Two dolls "body surfed" through the crowd.</p>

<p>I was out of things to do when I was finally rescued by the Librarian "coming home" and she asked me to read them the book.</p>

<p>I sat down among the crowd and used my loudest voice to read the story. For the most part they paid good attention. </p>

<p>From there the evening was a blur. I noticed things were a bit off kilter when a bunch of kids said they didn't get the craft project. Didn't get one??? We punted and gave away the gifts and cookies. Hey they even gave me a yo-yo too!</p>

<p>Afterwards as we were cleaning up, I had kids hug me, a couple Japanese kids danced the cat dance with me and had my picture taken with kids which was fun. I got down on my knees as this 7-foot-tall cat would tower over the 4-foot-tall kids.</p>

<p>Then I heard the kicker. One of our volunteers did a count as they were hearing a story. We had 76 kids show up for the party and that didn't include the umpteen toddlers who came with their parents (or the parents themselves). We had well over 100 folks in the auditorium.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, I'm not sure I would have done it if I knew I'd be the Cat for more than 100 as opposed to my assumed 20. But it worked and I had a lot of fun. What can I say, I am enough of a ham to pull it off.</p>

<p>I've always been a character. Now I know I can be a character.</p>

	<h3>My evening in the children's room</h3>
	
	<p>I worked tonight instead of my usual Wednesday as the children's librarian went to a conference today.</p>

<p>I helped some high school students with a project that seemed a little too broad (just about everything under the sun dealing with the turn of the 19th to 20th century from Mother Jones to inventions). I also shelved some books. </p>

<p>I'm always amazed how many cool children's books there are in our library. I have no idea if the kids think they're cool, but I do. </p>

<p>Tonight I read easy readers about a Chinese girl celebrating the Fourth of July, a boy whose robot goes crazy when he should be in bed sleeping, a Jewish girl preparing for the sabbath dinner with her grandmother, about a young girl in Jim Crow Nashville discoving the library (the only integrated place in the city practically), and one illustrating blues lyrics.</p>

<p>The latter two books were eye reopening. Certainly, I've read about what life was like under segregation. But the living the easy life of small-town America 2004, you forget the pain that was suffered. I never realized that Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit" referred to lynchings. I never heard the lyrics.</p>

<p>After reading a children's book (a children's book!!!!), it leaves one wondering how one could ever forget.</p>

<p>"Southern trees bear strange fruit,<br />
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root,<br />
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze,<br />
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees."</p>

	<h3>Speaking of geese or ducks actually...</h3>
	
	<p>I've finally gotten enough ducks in a row for grad school-- though a few are still quacking and straggling behind. </p>

<p>Today I plunked down my $50 and submitted my application to the Indiana University School of Library and Information Science. </p>

<p>I still need to send them one of my transcripts. I ordered them, but somehow I have a bill of $106 at Bowling Green State University. I haven't the foggiest how it got there as I had transferred to Miami University with no problem. The only thing Darlene can think of is she got a parking ticket driving a car in my name. Thus, no transcript. Go figure.</p>

<p>Also I need to get my recommendations in, or rather herd my recommendations in. So far only one of people who agreed to be references has turned in their work. Another promised to finish it this week. I haven't talked to the third. It's actually a bit of work. There's about a dozen questions to answer and an essay to write (up to 5000 characters). While I joke about herding ducks, I really appreciate their willingness to do so. </p>

<p>I talked to the one gentleman who wrote me a reference. He is a retired academic library director who serves on our board. He is amazingly happy that I decided to pursue the profession and promised to be on my back until I finished the masters. I'll take the encouragement where I can get it.</p>

<p>I had known him for several years as a reporter. But, not long after I started at the library, I unknowingly helped out his father with some reference questions. He later told me that his father came home that day and really complimented the service. Ever since then he's asked me every six months or so if I was planning to pursue an MLS.</p>

<p>I suspect it goes a little further than that. Like myself, he stumbled across librarianship from another profession and found he enjoyed it. There are still so few men in the profession (I think I read 21%) that when a new one joins in, the current men rejoice?</p>

	<p>Another entry from out "only at a library" collection....</p>

<p>One of our assistants was picking up stray papers near our photocopier and found the original of a cut and paste worksheet on sign language.</p>

<p>"Huh, sign language, that's cool. What in the...?" and she laughed her head off.</p>

<p>It was more than a dozen signs all dealing with sex. Use your imagination as to what signs were on the sheet. </p>

	<h3>Twilight zone quality</h3>
	
	<p>Interesting week to say the least...</p>

<p>In the outside world::</p>

<p>Poor Paul Hamm is still suffering at the hands of the FIG (don't give up the gold).</p>

<p>Bush says we can't win the war on terrorism (then "flip-flops" like a fish out of water trying to explain it all).</p>

<p>I feel bad for whomever wrote the speech the Bush girls gave as they'll be living out the rest of the year in the gulag.</p>

<p>In our life::</p>

<p>I spoke before a plan commission meeting where I'm quoted as saying the word <a href="http://www.madisoncourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=4&SubSectionID=263&ArticleID=19852">"holistically" </a> before the board. I don't remember it. Though I admit I don't remember much of what I did say-- it's amazing how you quickly one can become a deer in the headlights. </p>

<p>Today, our assistant director and I attended a grant writing workshop where we were supposed to have come prepared to start working on writing a grant. There was only one problem... no one told us. It was supposed to be in the confirmation letter, but it was not. Fortunately (and unfortunately) I have 30 days to come up with a grant idea and write the proposal. I'll obviously be meeting with the director in the morning. We couldn't pull one out of the air that didn't fit our plans and I already have a grant I'm trying to administer (as well as the 2005-2007 technology plan I'm working on).</p>

<p>Darlene meanwhile has pots all over the place in the studio. Literally on every exposed surface. It's a lot of fun to watch (especially as the shelves are getting bare and we have a show coming up).</p>

<p>That's life on the river's edge.</p>

	<h3>Only at a library...</h3>
	
	<p>could this possibly happen.  </p>

<p>We got a video returned today where the box was chewed to pieces by a dog. </p>

<p>Fortunately, the video was in one piece, but we were all rolling when we discovered the title. "Basic Dog Obedience." It apparently failed to have an impact. </p>

<p>Maybe the human should have been watching it instead of the dog.</p>

	<h3>Fair was a success</h3>
	
	<p>We survived the Jefferson County 4-H Fair in one piece. Other than needing to get the talking points out to everyone things worked rather well for our first time out.</p>

<p>The biggest hit was our Accu-Cut puzzles. We printed out 4 per page flyers that said "Puzzled? Come to the Library for Answers." We used that as a talking point with the kids and parents. We then had them drawing pictures on the back. I hammed it up with the kids. I had them say magical words "ugily, buggily, boo!" and roled the puzzle through the cutter "and poof, you have a puzzle."</p>

<p>However, I suspect that free-form drawing is becoming a lost art as a number of kids were dumbstruck with the concept. I continued hamming it up and made suggestions to get their brains going. "You can draw cars, balloons, sheep, horses, hearts... hey, you could even draw me!" pregnent pause. "No? I guess not." They'd laugh and start drawing something. However, a mother-daughter combo actually took me up on the joke. That was even funnier.</p>

<p>A few days later, Darlene ran into a mother who said her kids were <b>still</b> playing with the puzzles and were even making up games to play with them. So while kids drawing may be a lost art, creativity is not!</p>

<p>I think we managed to have 300 folks doing puzzles over the week.</p>

<p>Our drawing for free books and CDs was a general success as well. We drew 42 winners from more than 340 entries. About half of the winners had picked up their prizes when I left for Ohio yesterday.</p>

<p>For prizes we used the duplicate CDs from the "CD price-fixing" settlement shipment we received earlier this summer. We also used a small number of the books donated to the library that we didn't add to the collection.</p>

<p>It was fun.</p>

	<h3>At the fair</h3>
	
	<p>It's a Friday at the library which is nice as I can get some work done.</p>

<p>I'll be at the Jefferson County 4-H Fair next week with our assistant director and others representing the library. It could be fun. I created a game of Jefferson County trivia that I hope will be fun for people. I'm working on a simple Powerpoint presentation of some of the photos that's in our <a href="http://madison-jeffco.cdm.oclc.org">photo history website.</a></p>

<p>We'll also have library puzzles for the kids. On one side is a puzzle and on the other side kids can draw a picture. We'll then cut it into an 8-piece puzzle for them. Combine that with general info and I think we'll be busy enough.</p>

<p>I'll miss swimming though as I'll probably be working 1-10 p.m. each day.</p>

<p>A couple more entries and I'll have hit 200. Hmmm. I'll have to make sure it's an interesting one.</p>

		<h2>06.11.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>A slew of CDs on our doorstep</h3>
	
	<p>A paraphrased conversation at the Madison-Jefferson County Public Library this afternoon:</p>

<p>"Did you order a bunch of CDs?"<br />
"Just that order for 15 the other day."<br />
"So you didn't order 257"<br />
"Err, no."</p>

<p>After a heartbeat I remembered about the CD Settlement.</p>

<p>Last year, the top CD distributers and retailers agreed to  <a title="Wired News: Few Takers for CD Settlement Cash" href="http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,57111,00.html">pay out more than $140 million in cash and CDs</a> to settle a lawsuit that charged they fixing music prices.</p>

<p>As part of the deal, libraries would get a chunk of the proceeds. I expected maybe a couple dozen not couple dozen-dozen in six boxes.</p>

<p>The titles cover the whole spectrum of music, many of which are out of print cast offs. Others though are pretty cool. </p>

<p>I was pleased to see some jazz with Lionel Hampton and Thelonious Monk. The pop selection was so-so. Who really wants two CDs from 98 Degrees?</p>

<p>Some of them we got two and three copies of such as Atlantic Records 50th Anniversary set.</p>

<p>Last-- and probably least -- there was the "Martha Stewart's Living: Spooky and Scary Sounds for Halloween." Well, we do have a sound effects category, but I certainly would not have ordered it myself.</p>

<p>Our cataloger was obviously floored. I promised to go through them and only have her do a couple dozen at a time.</p>

<p>While I wouldn't have bought half of them on my own, it will certainly have an impact on our collection.</p>

<p>It'd be tempting not to buy another CD this year and roll the music money over into our budding, but hot DVD collection. But I can't let the siren call from Norah Jones go unanswered.</p>

	<h3>Even cicadas like our library</h3>
	
	<p>I've heard people call Brood X an invasion. The cicadas are definitely in full force here in Madison and we are inundated with the red-eyed, vainy-winged bugs.</p>

<p>As the front door of our library opens, the buzz roars in and fades out as the door shuts once again.</p>

<p>That's been the scenario for the past 10 days. Today, however, I think the cicadas have finally realized what a cool library we have. They're riding their way in on the backs of our patrons.</p>

<p>This afternoon, a mom was checking out books as I was helping her daughter learn how to use Indiana's Virtual Library <a href="http://www.inspire.net">Inspire.net</a>. Suddenly, we heard a very loud chirping from across the reading room. The young woman's mother was jumping around clearly stunned. Soon, the poor woman realized there was a cicada in her purse. </p>

<p>Not three minutes later, I'm still helping the student find journal articles on viruses and an older gentleman walked in and started chirping as well. As he found one in his pocket, the two of us couldn't keep from laughing. He promptly dropped it on the floor and crunched it with his foot. Just what we needed, crushed cicada on our carpet.</p>

<p>An hour later, I was checking out some videos for a young man who suddenly grabbed at his neck and found a cicada crawling down the collar of his shirt. Even knowing he had it in his hand we both jumped when the thing started chirping. Those puppies are loud.</p>

<p>The buggers are falling from the trees, swarm at the lightest distraction and, unlike flies, know nothing of people, dogs, cars or anything else on earth for that matter. They're all over the sidewalks and streets, many dead having been stomped on or driven over. I had a couple "riding" on my bike. </p>

<p>They're even showing public displays of affection.  I now regularly see pairs of cicadas on top of each. I was suddenly glad not to have children at this immediate point. Not only would I have to explain the birds and the bees, but cicadas as well. </p>

<p>One of our patrons in this very boat said she was very happy when her kid readily settled for the answer of "they're mating." She's not sure if the child knew what the word meant, but was happy to not have to explain it.</p>

<p>While I'm glad we've visited by Brood X only once every 17 years, I'm enjoying the spectacle. </p>

<p>This morning I went to the Hanover College library to pick up some inter-library loan books that were mis-routed seven miles in the wrong direction. Hanover is a very leafy campus and it was evident from the holes in the ground that there were a few million bugs along with the 2,000 students. </p>

<p>The funny thing was the sound. There were so many of them that the overall aural feel of the cicada calls had changed. Instead of sounding like crickets on acid, the hum took on a whiring sound not unlike what you'd hear from space ships in 1950s sci-fi movies.</p>

<p>Hmmm, maybe we are being invaded.</p>

	<h3>Library's been sassed and suffered dead controllers, but we'll be wireless</h3>
	
	<p>Our library has been trying to get away from using our tech consultant as much this year, but it seems we're instead using him more.</p>

<p>Yesterday is a good example. We got sassed pretty bad by that Sasser.c worm. It started shutting down a couple of our computers on Saturday and Sunday and knocked out several more on Monday. I had updated many of our public access machines and OPACs with the latest patches after hearing of the lastest critical patch from Microsoft, but a few staff machines out of my domain had not been updated in a while and got hit.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, to "cure" the problem, the first thing was to insure the firewall was installed or installed properly. I know little about firewalls beyond how they work... so here comes the consultant again. Fortunately I was around when he came and I plumbed him for information -- though I still don't know about the mechanical firewall. He did suggest trying ZoneAlarm on our Windows2000 computers. I'm test driving it now.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the computer we use for our pretty cool <a href="http://madison-jeffco.cdm.oclc.org">digitization project</a> has been on the fritz for weeks and, after several attempts, Gateway finally sent us the right parts. Apparently the panel that controls the hard drives went south. </p>

<p>Finally, I need to send our wireless Internet project out for quotes as we want a pro to do the initial setup. We received a Library Services and Technology Act grant I wrote for the project and have just returned the paperwork to the state library.</p>

<p>I sent my draft to the head of technology at the local college for a critique and I still haven't heard back. I need to give him a call tomorrow. I'd hope to be started by now, but it'll happen.</p>

<p>Starting June 1, our building will be undergoing a massive building project to install and entirely new heating, air conditioning, ventilation system. Different parts of the building will be disrupted and the ability to move computers around at will would be nice to say the least.</p>

<p>Dealing with technology is part of my job description, but after weeks like this I wonder if I should study computers as opposed to library science.</p>

	<h3>100th anniversary of NYC Carnegie gift</h3>
	
	<p>In today's <a title="The Writer's Almanac - MARCH 8-14, 2004" href="http://www.writersalmanac.org/docs/04_03_08.htm#friday">Writer's Almanac</a> by Garrison Keiler, it's noted:</p>

<blockquote>"On this day in 1901, industrialist Andrew Carnegie gave New York City 5.2 million dollars to construct sixty-five libraries. 

<p>"He had just sold the Carnegie Steel Company to J. P. Morgan for 250 million dollars, and decided to retire and devote himself to giving it all away. </p>

<p>"He later donated money to create more than 2,500 libraries all over the United States and Britain. By the time he died, Carnegie had given away over 350 million dollars. </p>

<p>"He said, "The man who enters a library is in the best society this world affords; the good and the great welcome him, surround him, and humbly ask to be allowed to become his servants."</blockquote></p>

	<h3>New uses for book carts</h3>
	
	<p>There was a group of teens in the library today joy riding in the elevator (real excitement in a small town I'm sure). I went around the library to make sure they weren't hopping off in staff areas. </p>

<p>I never found them, but down in the basement I found two other kids. One was sitting a book carts as the other was pushing him around down the non-fiction video aisle. Not that a 100 pounds of boy would do much damage, but it might violate our warrentee.</p>

<p>"You don't want us riding on this?" Good question.<br />
"No, it's library property."<br />
Poof they disappeared.</p>

	<h3>Bad library joke</h3>
	
	<p>For the first time, everyone in the library now has their individual emails. To give us incentive to check it, our director promised to send along a joke now and then. Here's the first joke:</p>

<blockquote>One day a librarian sees a chicken walk up to her desk and
cluck, "book-book-book- BOOOOOK." She follows the chicken while it pecks at six books and pulls out a library card.

<p>The next week the whole sequence happens again, and the curious librarian follows the chicken to see where it's going with all these books. She follows it to a pond, where the chicken gives the books to a frog, who glances at the titles and throws them aside, saying "readdit! readdit! readdit!"</blockquote></p>

	<h3>I'm dangerous! I read! Heck I might even have an almanac in my car�</h3>
	
	<p>Good grief! I thought I had heard everything. Now the FBI has issued an advisory prompting police to keep an eye out for people carrying almanacs in their cars. </p>

<p>They argue that almanacs are full with information which could be valuable to a terrorist. No joke, the Associated Press confirmed it.</p>

<p>This kind of information can be found anywhere. If a person has a laptop with a wi-fi card in it, they can get on the net in almost any city. There's all the terrorist info you could possible need.</p>

<p>Thus I think the FBI should stop every businessperson in NYC to check the history in their web browser for possible terrorist links.</p>

<p>Heck, just shut down the Internet, censor the newspapers and close the libraries and bookstores while you're at it.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice may or may not have requested lists of what patrons are reading courtesy of the Patriot Act, but the government sure seems to have curious, literate people in their crosshairs.</p>

<p>Here's an article about it from Witchita, Kans. <a href="http://www.kansas.com/mld/kansas/7682394.htm">An almanac of worries for librarians after Sept. 11</a></p>

	<h3>Grant writing</h3>
	
	<p>I'm tripping through the wires of grant writing today. I've never written a grant and now I'm trying to get a couple thousand dollars through the federal Library Services and Technology Assistance grant program.</p>

<p>We hope to have wireless access to the Internet and our network throughout the library using "wi-fi" or 802.11g technology. It's pretty cool stuff actually, it's what allows me to surf the web in bed if I want as we have wi-fi in our building.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I have a number of people to rely on to bend this thing into a form that might actually secure a grant. Our assistant director has written grants but knows little about techology. I'm vise-versa. We'll be turning it in next week. I'll let you all know how it turns out.</p>

	<h3>The Librarian Action Figure</h3>
	
	<p><strong>The Librarian Action Figure</strong></p>

<p>Librarians either love it or hate it, but the Librarian Action Figure is certainly making waves. Our director purchased the doll which is now on display behind our circulation desk. She couldn't resist opening the package to test out the "shushing action." It didn't seem to work too well.</p>

<p>A Librarian Action Figure? Here's a New York Times article to explain it all. You might have to register to read the article, but it's free. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/09/books/09LIBR.html?8hpib=&pagewanted=all&position=">A Librarian Is Making a Big Noise</a></p>

	<h3>An afternoon on the Reference Desk</h3>
	
	<p><strong>An afternoon on the Reference Desk</strong></p>

<p>The afternoon was pleasently busy with strange questions that left me batting .500. Mind you the ones I hit were pretty good pitches. </p>

<p>I was able to find the monthly average price for chicken over the past three years. According to the patron neither her professor nor the ref folks at the Indiana University Southeast Library were able to find that one.</p>

<p>The ones I missed were "I happened to see #### and can't find it again." They unfortunately didn't remember enough information for me to find it for them. *sigh*</p>

<p>Meanwhile I'm trying to whip our historical photos website into shape and am only partially succeeding in that endeavor.<br />
<a href="http://madison-jeffco.cdm.oclc.org">The Lemen Collection</a> is making its debut in two weeks and I have many tweaks to go.</p>

	<h3>National Library Week is coming</h3>
	
	<p>National Library Week is coming up and our library has a number of activites in store. Two that I'm coordinating are a prose and poetry coffeehouse and a workshop on blogging (thus I'm creating one as an example).</p>

<p>The coffeehouse is from 6-8:30 p.m. on Wednesday, April 17. It features an open mic session where anyone from 13 to 113 can read original work. It will be followed by the area's first poetry slam. What's a slam? Well, it's a competitive reading where judges picked from the audience give Olympic like scores to writers who perform their work. The score is based on content, performance and overall impact of the work. The audience is encouraged to respond to the writers and to what they think of the judge's scoring. The bottom line is an enjoyable evening of home-grown literature and performance in a fun atmosphere.</p>

<p>The workshop will cover the new rage called "blogging," which is short for web logs. It's an easy and powerful way to publish to the web.</p>

<p>Check out our <a href="http://www.madison-jeffco.lib.in.us">library's website</a> and click on the National Library Week link.</p>
