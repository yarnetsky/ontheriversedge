	<h3>May you live in interesting times</h3>
	
	<p>Right now I feel like I was given one of those fortune cookies that read��May you live in interesting times� or some such.</p>

<p>Right now I�m in over my head with homework. In five weeks I�ve written more than 50 pages in papers and I have at least another dozen to go before I can quit next week. I think the last time I wrote that much in a short period of time was for our local paper during the 1997 flood.</p>

<p>Either way, after this class I�ll be a third of the way toward a masters degree.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I have once again shuffled myself into the middle of a historic preservation hullabaloo as a member of the Madison Historic District Board of Review.</p>

<p>A property owner pre-meditatively violated our historic district ordinance after we turned him down for vinyl windows on his 19th century industrial/commercial building. All of the sudden, my name�s been in the paper about every other day and on local online forums.</p>

<p>The board is in a bad position. One one hand we have a very weak ordinance with no design guidelines. On the other our community has a strong libertarian streak where people don�t like to be told what to do with their properties. It amazes me that through all this some people seem to think we enjoy doing what we do.</p>

<p>I�m learning to live with the notion I�ll be a punching bag for people�s views on preservation in Madison. However, I just hope people will continue allowing me to serve them in peace at the library (if that makes sense).</p>

	<h3>Oh Scotty, you were the intelligent life down here</h3>
	
	<p>James Doohan, the gentleman who brought Montgomery Scott alive on Star Trek died this morning. Scotty and Leonard "Bones" McCoy were my favorites. </p>

<p>I love that he never got sick of the "phrase": </p>

<blockquote>In a 1998 interview, Doohan was asked if he ever got tired of hearing the line ''Beam me up, Scotty.''

<p>''I'm not tired of it at all,'' he replied. ''Good gracious, it's been said to me for just about 31 years. It's been said to me at 70 miles an hour across four lanes on the freeway. I hear it from just about everybody. It's been fun.''</blockquote></p>

<p>Here's his obit: <a title="'Star Trek' Star James Doohan Dies - New York Times" href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/arts/AP-Obit-Doohan.html">'Star Trek' Star James Doohan Dies - New York Times</a></p>

	<h3>Trying to shift the news cycle</h3>
	
	<p>The news for the past few weeks was that Bush planned to take some time and ponder his choice for Supreme Court ... then suddenly poof! Out comes a nomination out of the hat. (<a title="Bush Chooses Judge Roberts for Supreme Court - New York Times" href="http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/politics/politics-bush-court.html">Bush Chooses Judge Roberts for Supreme Court - New York Times</a>)</p>

	<h3>Costco: Retail done right?</h3>
	
	<p>Would you shop at a warehouse store that paid its employees well yet still had good price?</p>

<p>Would you shop at a warehouse store that doesn't roll over at every whim of Wall Street?  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.costco.com">Costco</a> is a very, very interesting business. I've never been to one, but I am definitely planning to look for one.</p>

<p>Check out this article in the New York Times (free registration) to get a feel for the place. <a title="How Costco Became the Anti-Wal-Mart - New York Times" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/17/business/yourmoney/17costco.html?incamp=article_popular_2&pagewanted=all">How Costco Became the Anti-Wal-Mart.</a></p>

<p>The kicker for me? They support Democrats! Here's their profile on <a href="http://www.buyblue.org/detail.php?corpId=17">BuyBlue.com</b>. </p>

		<h2>07.18.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Bush "shifting" on Plame blame? Try "shafting"...</h3>
	
	<p>OK now, on June 10, 2004, President Bush was asked if he would fire anyone who had anything to do with the leaking Valerie Plame-Wilson's name as a covert CIA agent. Bush responded "yes" and his spokeman since repeated the statement to the White House press corps.</p>

<p>How come today, he is suddenly "shifting" his position as USA Today put it?<br />
Now  he'll <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-07-18-bush-rove_x.htm">"if someone committed a <b><i>crime</i></b>, they will no longer work in my administration."</a></p>

<p>To me that essentially says he <b><i>knows</i></b> someone (or someones) in his administration most definitely messed with Plame, but he doesn't want to do a damn thing about it.</p>

<p>Striking out at Plame because her husband discredited the Bush rally cry to war would be playground petty if she were not with the CIA. However, she was an agent and to me that borders on treason.</p>

<p>Why? Consider this question... if Plame is outted as a covert agent, isn't that in turn going to out anyone who covertly worked with her?</p>

<p>This isn't the only thing about his statement today that drives me bats-- how about the notion that he's known about the allegation for two years and says he "doesn't know all the facts." For that to be true he must have told everyone involved to keep him in the dark so he wouldn't have to testify.</p>

<p>If there's any saving grace its that the White House press corps finally has a string to pull. They suddenly seem to realize they've been lied to and are trying to unravel the mess we're in. Mind you, the odds of that happening are still pretty slim, but you can't blame a cat for dreaming.</p>

	<h3>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince arrives</h3>
	
	<p>Darlene just got an email that the new Harry Potter book had shipped. "Shoot, I guess that means I won't get it today. Oh, who knows maybe they'll deliver it later. You can always hope."</p>

<p>Well, not 10 minutes later, I hear a light knock on the door. I had to scramble to get downstairs. The mailman was already down the street, but I managed to catch him.</p>

<p>Of course, he hands me a box labeled "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince."</p>

<p>I now have a happy potter reading Harry Potter...</p>

	<h3>New Music Thursday</h3>
	
	<p>I bought some new CDs for the first time in probably years. I had been promising Darlene some new jazz for a while and now that I've played a few tracks I think I chose well. Here's what I snagged from <a href="http://www.houseohits.com/hoh/index.htm">House O' Hits Records</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>"<b>Stay Loose...Jimmy Smith Sings Again</b>": This guy is great on the Hammond B3 organ. One of his better albums from the 1960s.</li>
<li>"<b>The Definitive Chet Baker</b>": So far I like his trumpet better than his vocals, but not bad when he combines the two. I bought this one on a whim.</li>
<li>"<b>Compact Jazz Lionel Hampton</b>": This is not one of the better Hampton collections, but I love him on the vibraphone. Hey it was a used CD.</li>
</ul>
The test obviously is whether she'll like them...

	<h3>How does blogging impact web accessibility?</h3>
	
	<p>Right now I'm taking "Resources and Technology for Patrons with Special Needs" and I'm doing research for a 20 page paper (20 pages maximum thank God).</p>

<p>I write this and Darlene, reading over my shoulder, says "Ha! Knowing you, you'll have a hard time keeping it to 20 pages." I'm glad she's optimistic.</p>

<p>Either way, I'm opening this to the wisdom of the masses. </p>

<p>My topic is how does blogging (and content management software in general) impact accessibility of the resulting websites? Is the software itself user-friendly to bloggers (or would-be bloggers) who have sight impairments? What can we do to improve the situation?</p>

<p>While much of designing blogs for accessibility echoes accessible web design in general, there are other things that are unique to blogging software. For example, in order to post comments on some sites, you have to type in the distorted letters seen in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">captcha illustration</a>. That'd be impossible for someone using a screen reader. </p>

<p>In the case of <a href="http://www.blogger.com">blogger.com</a>, you have to type in the captcha before you can even get a blog. Understandable? Yes, as it keeps computers from signing up for millions of blogs. Accessible? No. How can a person who is blind blog when they can't get a blog from Blogger?</p>

<p>That's one example. Right now I'm harvesting articles for my research. If any of you have any ideas on avenues of exploration, etc., let me know... </p>

	<h3>Lost Civil Liberties</h3>
	
	<p>My mom visited us just before the holiday and brought us an Alice in Wonderland mug that had a disappearing Cheshire cat when you put in hot water. The mug is great (it doesn't hurt that I love the Sir John Tenniel's illustrations). </p>

<p>Today I stumbled upon another product from the Unemployed Philosphers Guild: the <a title="Unemployed Philosophers Guild: Lost Civil Liberties mug" href="http://www.philosophersguild.com/index.lasso?page_mode=Product_Detail&item=0236">Lost Civil Liberties mug</a>.</p>

<p>Amazing how a cup of coffee can share such truths.</p>

	<h3>Organic groceries in Madison!</h3>
	
	<p>Madison has joined the big leagues of food. A new grocery open here downtown that offers organic food, fruit, vegatables, meats and cheeses. The variety is wonderful.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.localharvestmarket.com">Local Harvest Market</a>. They're planning an "e-market" that will open soon so you can get an idea of what they're carrying.</p>

<p>What amazes me is they even have FRESH fish flown in from the coast three times a week. I don't know the last time I've had fresh fish. Also every kind of meat you can imagine-- we can even get bison, rabbit and duck. If you have the opportunity, you should try organic free-range chicken eggs. They really are pretty amazing.</p>

<p>They also have prepared meals. We had beef curry rice for dinner tonight. They also had grilled swordfish with pineapple and mango sauce. They'll even make you sandwiches from fresh baked bread and premium Boar's Head meats from their deli cut to order. I'm told sushi is also coming soon.</p>

<p>I know one of the people who will be working there and she said they all attended workshops to learn about the products they'll be selling. Indeed, she attended a fullday on just wines and cheeses.</p>

<p>While I doubt I could afford to buy all my food there, but I am very much looking forward to sampling the fare, this will be fun-- real food!</p>
