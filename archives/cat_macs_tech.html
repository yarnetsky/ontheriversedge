	<h3>Podcasts I listen to</h3>
	
	<p>I've added a podcast category to my links list at right. Every Friday during my drive to Indianapolis for class I listen to the past week's podcasts. Without my iPod and these programs my trip would be much less bareable.</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.openstacks.net/os/" target="_blank"><b>Open Stacks</b></a>: Friend Greg Schwartz, a librarian at the Louisville Free Public Library, does this podcast about library and information science topics. Every other week he takes the news of note, gives us the background and his personal thoughts. Each of his 13 episodes has had something I found either interesting or though provoking. If libraries are your thing, this is a must listen.</li>
<li> <a href="http://escape.extraneous.org/" target="_blank"><b>Escape Pod</b></a>: I don't know how I stumbled upon this new podcast, but it is certainly a blast. Traditionally, cutting edge science fiction had been written in short story form. However, in part due to the dumping of bad work on the market, the format has dropped out of favor. This podcast hopes to bring the format back to life, reading a new short sci-fi story each week.</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.maccast.com/" target="_blank"><b>The MacCast</b></a>: News for Mac Geek by Mac Geeks. Adam reads the Apple news of the day and contributes analysis. Other members of the MacCast community contribute audio comments, reviews and questions. I usually only listen to the news in the opening of the program, but sometimes the other stuff is pretty good too.</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/" target="_blank"><b>On the Media</b></a>: This is a National Public Radio program posted every Friday by WNYC in New York. This is a great program that doesn't flinch in its efforts to make sense of today's media world. I find it fascinating both as a former journalist and current political junkie</li>
</ul>

	<h3>I'm scritchin a Tiger between the ears</h3>
	
	<p>This morning I starred at the ring of fire and leaped through to Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.</p>

<p>I've been playing with it on and off all a day and it is one sweet cat. I get an educational discount so Tiger only ran me $70, but I'm thinking I'd be happy if I did have to pay $130. Here's my experience so far...</p>

<p><b>Installation</b>: Installation was mostly painless though I did decent amount of preparation to avoid trouble. Here's what I did...</p>

<p>I backed up my user folders, my applications and libraries. At that point I ran out of space on my iPod. I used Onyx to repair permissions, cleared cache and ran the maintenance scripts. Then I ran DiskWarrior and repaired the directories. I double checked whether I needed any new firmware.</p>

<p>Then I bit the bullet and installed Tiger. I was mildly surprised that the default setup simply upgrades the system. You have to chose "options" to choose either an "archive and install" or "erase and install." I chose "archive and install" as it gave me a clean new system folder while still porting over my old settings. The whole process from there was maybe 30 minutes tops.</p>

<p>A few things didn't work off the bat. Norton's doesn't work and Virtual PC needs an minor upgrade. If you go to the <a href="http://www.macintouch.com/tigerreview/">Macintouch</a> website, you'll find a full review including a software compatibility chart. It reported that there were a few security problems and asked if I wanted to fix them. I did, but I honestly don't know what it meant. Even so, the shakeout time was minimal.</p>

<p><b>It's a speedy cat</b>: Once Spotlight, Tiger's new system searching software, finished indexed my hard drive the speed differences became evident. It sounds odd, but everything simply does what it should when it should. There's no lag time. "Crisp" is a good word. </p>

<p>I'm using a Powerbook G4 1.33ghz computer so it's reasonably quick, but under 10.3 it still slugged along occasionally. That's no longer the case. The difference between 10.3 and 10.4 is very noticable. </p>

<p>Apps are faster as well. The new versions of Safari and Mail pack some speed improvements, but I was astounded by the speed change in Firefox. It seems to pull down pages in an instant. iPhoto 5 is a lightyear better than iPhoto 4 under 10.3. The iTunes Music Store downloads pages in a flash under Tiger. All in all, it truly feels like I have high-speed Internet now.</p>

<p><b>Visually interesting</b>: The new video technologies in this build are impressive. The interface can ripple and wave with no apparent hit to the performance. The new Quicktime 7 is beautiful. Quicktime videos have a polish I simply did not expect-- they are crystal clear. If you have a widescreen powerbook or monitor, the QT7 features HD capabilities that will blow you away.</p>

<p>Mind you, there are portions of the interface that I'd almost call ugly, Mail 2.0 for example. Hey you can't win them all.</p>

	<h3>I feel so dirty</h3>
	
	<p>When I started grad school I figured I'd never again have an opportunity to purchase affordable software so I purchased about everything that made sense. Mind you, I've been so busy I haven't had time to use any of it.</p>

<p>However, tonight I did and so help me, it put Windows XP on my wonderful Apple PowerBook G4.... aaarrrgggghhh... I feel so dirty.</p>

<p>A friend and fellow Mac user brought over some CDs that for some reason could not be read on a Mac. He couldn't read them and I couldn't read them. So for the first time, I used Virtual PC and fired up Windows XP. Low and behold, I could read the discs. </p>

<p>I use Windows at work so that wasn't a big deal, but it took me a good hour to figure out how Virtual PC worked so I find the files and burn him a new disk on the Mac side of things. </p>

<p>Maybe there's a lesson in all this. Maybe it shows that sometimes you have to compromise yourself in order to attain the greater good. Even though I may hate it, I now know I can run Windows on my laptop if it means helping a friend. Is this what it's like to co-sponsor legislation with a Republican? *wink*</p>

	<h3>Soundtracks, iPods and Cyborgs</h3>
	
	<p>I was recently emailing Greg (of <a href="http://www.openstacks.net/os">Open Stacks</a> blog-podcast fame) about movie soundtracks. From that email, lets follow a chain of casual connections...</p>

<p>Neither of us have much affection for movie soundtracks. The beasts are often cobbled together spin-offs just to make more money. Heck, half the songs on the soundtrack can't even be found on the film anymore.</p>

<p>There are exceptions to the rule, often when the soundtrack transcends the film itself. The soundtrack to "Young Einstein," is my favorite case in point. </p>

<p>The movie was a super low budget comedy written, directed, produced and starring Australian actor <a href="http://www.yahooserious.com">Yahoo Serious</a>. It imagines Albert Einstein growing up as a Tasmanian, discovering his theory of relativity while brewing beer and romancing Marie Curie while trying to keep his theories from being used to make atomic bombs. </p>

<p>Stopping to read reviews of the movie, I find myself wondering why I remember enjoying it. Hey, it was 15 years ago. However, a more likely reason is the soundtrack.</p>

<p>While "Young Einstein" became one of the biggest films to come out of Australia and achieved some cult status, the soundtrack did even better selling more than 2 million copies. The album is chock full of cool Australian rock from groups like the Saints, Paul Kelly, Big Pig, Icehouse and the Lime Spiders. I listened to the cassette I don't know how many times until it died from a case of sun stroke on the dashboard of our car.</p>

<p>Similarly, I'll admit that I can't listen to Simple Minds' "Don't You Forget About Me" without thinking about the movie "The Breakfast Club" (and on occasion the fact the movie was my first real date with my first high school love.)</p>

<p>Thus through connections to life, soundtracks can chronical time as much as the movie itself.</p>

<p>So, if you were a cyborg, would you have all the music of your lifetime stored in your brain so you could replay it like the soundtrack of your life?</p>

<p>It's arguable that us iPod owners, with anywhere from 512mb to 60gb of music at our fingertips, already have our life's soundtrack at our fingertips and piping into our brains via white earbuds. </p>

<p>Indeed, I've read complaints to that effect. Soundtracks play in the background of the film, sometimes, but rarely advancing the plotline. Critics claim iPods play nothing more than background music to life.  They argue that we really don't enjoy music as it was intended (we shuffle instead of listening to albums straight through). We're not reaching out for new musical experiences, creating playlists of our favorite songs (memories). To top it off, we're not even listening to the real music as it's stuffed with lossy 128mb MP3s -- pixelated versions of the real uncompressed tracks. (Boy that sounds like a government conspiracy). </p>

<p>But a tech marketing guru thinks it's going beyond that. He argues that when we start using the iPods to store our files, our calendar reminders, our music and our contacts, it becomes an extension of ourselves. (What's that phone number? let me check my iPod contacts list).  Thus what difference does it make if this extension is in our pocket or in our brains. We're now cyborgs.</p>

<p>It's an interesting argument. Read more: <a title="Wired News: My IPod, My Self" href="http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,66426,00.html?tw=rss.MAC">Wired My IPod, My Self</a> at Wired.com<br />

	<h3>Minis, Shuffles and Pages oh my!</h3>
	
	<p>Every year about this time, Mac Addicts around the world start dreaming and drooling over what Steve Jobs might announce during the MacWorld Conference Keynote.</p>

<p>Well this morning was the morning and I'm really rather impressed with the results. </p>

<p>Here are what I consider the highlights:</p>

<p>They finally have the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle">$99 iPod</a> everyone want. It's called the iPod Shuffle. It's the size of a pack of gum. An elegant white pack of gum. No screen to pick out the tunes, rather you program a playlist through iTunes and load it up. You can either have it loop the list or shuffle the list at random. You can even use it as a flash drive. 512mb for $99 or 1gb for $149.</p>

<p>An interesting new word processing-design program called <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/pages/">Pages</a>. Pages is a mid-range product. It won't take the place of Quark XPress or Microsoft Word, but it looks like it can do the basics rather well. Lots of control over style and type. It also has term paper basics like footnotes and tables of contents. Best of all, it incorporates basic page design such as call-out boxes, photos and columns. I'm hoping everyone who's the editor of a club newsletter gets their hands on a copy. Because it's loaded with some pretty decent templates, even the worst Pages document would look better than what most of the junk created on a PC using Microsoft Publisher.</p>

<p>But probably what everyone was waiting for was the announcement of an awesome low-end computer-- the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini">Mac Mini</a> for $499. </p>

<p>You need to add a monitor, keyboard and mouse, but it'll take any standard accessory so you could get easily buy a decent setup for under $700. I'm noticing rebates for free keyboards and mouse at the online warehouses.</p>

<p>Apparently with an adapter you can even plug the Mac Mini into a television or stereo and it can be turned into an entertainment center for playing movie, looking at photo slideshows or listening to music.</p>

<p>Adding wirless and things like that will run up the cost a bit, but still it's a good deal.</p>

<p>The kicker? This puppy is small-- the size of a stack of CD cases 2 inches thick!</p>

<p>There's a lot, lot more! Those were just my three favs. For more details check out <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple's</a> website for details or <a href="http://www.macsurfer.com">MacSurfer</a> for a collection of headlines and commentary.</p>

	<h3>On blogging and blog reading</h3>
	
	<p>After "retiring" from journalism, I started this blog in 2003 as a way to get myself writing again. It's an easy way for friends and family to keep up with us and over the past year, for better or worse, it has also evolved into a personal soap box. </p>

<p>About once every six weeks I check the site statistics and every time the numbers have astounded me. I guess everyone who blogs wants to be read, but why have readers visited my blog <i>thousands</i> of times in 2004? </p>

<p>I visit blogs because they have something worthwhile to read. I like it when a writer manages to think outside the box and write something beyond the "echo chamber." When you read news, blogs and commentary on a regular basis, coming up with something unique is truly a challenge. Thus when it happens it's definitely worth reading. While my writing isn't horrible, I can't imagine more than a 10 of my 300 entries reaching that pinacle. </p>

<p>I suspect if I specialized on writing one topic, it would be easier to create good content. On the flip side, specialization takes a greater level of research, you cannot blog off the cuff as I always do. Nothing will kill a good entry faster than the lack of time or lack of motivation. I've lost count of the issues I have not written about due to the lack of one or the other.</p>

<p>Either way, with my writing and the possible interest people might have in it causes me to expect maybe 20 visits a day. Yet, I'm now averaging 250 a day. I realize a chunk are from search engines and another large chunk are from robots looking to deposit comment spam, but still why are the numbers growing? <br />
Are these numbers high for an off the cuff blog or is this pretty average or even low?</p>

<blockquote>Jan: 815 - Feb: 2,070 - March: 2,401 - April: 2,207 - May: 3,651 - June: 3,372 - July: 4,762 - Aug: 4,305 - Sept: 4,716 - Oct: 6,463 - Nov: 7,080 - Dec: 10,591.</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, nothing will change here much as I'll be starting grad school in a week. I'm excited and ready to go.</p>

	<h3>Joy of Tech</h3>
	
	<p>I recently added comics as a new category to my brown links bar. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.overduemedia.com/archive.aspx">Unshelved</a> is awesome if you love or work in libraries. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.geekculture.com/joyoftech/index.html">Joy of Tech</a> is a pretty good one for anyone who follows the "cult of mac" or simply enjoys good tech humor. Whenever the icon changes, you have a new Mac/Tech cartoon to read.</p>

<p>I like today's cartoon. I wish I could get away with the excuse. Here's the <a href="http://www.geekculture.com/joyoftech/joyarchives/635b.html">direct link</a> if you miss it.</p>

<p>I'll add more links to my favorite comics eventually, so keep an eye on the list.</p>

	<h3>Great commercial</h3>
	
	<p>It's well known that word of mouth can really help or kill a business, but what happens when your fans start doing advertising for you?</p>

<p>Wired News take a look at a <a title="Wired News: Home-Brew IPod Ad Opens Eyes" href="http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,66001,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_2">"Home-Brew IPod Ad"</a> that is doing just that. </p>

<p>I watched it a couple times, it is easily one of the best ads I've seen in a while. Take that with a grain of salt considering I don't watch television. Nonetheless, it is pretty cool.</p>

	<h3>Comments closed</h3>
	
	<p>As noted in an earlier post, I'm sick of the spam comments. I don't get many real comments to begin with. However, I've posted an email link, so feel free to harass me about anything I post or anything else-- though preferably no ads about Viagra, Texas Hold 'em or cheap pirated software. If you do email me, I may post the content as a comment in a "mailbag."</p>

	<h3>CSS Zen Garden and site changes</h3>
	
	<p>As you can see, my website has changed it's look yet again. </p>

<p>I see this as a natural progression as I've been using it not only to keep writing and to hop on a soap box, but also to teach myself CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). </p>

<p>I was inspired to dig back into the site design the other night when I saw the <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a> website. </p>

<p>CSS is pretty amazing stuff in the sense you can truly design with flexibility and grace. To prove the point the CSS Zen Garden takes the same HTML document and applies umpteen different style sheets. So far there are 150+ designs. Here's the portal to <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/alldesigns/">all the designs</a>. The conceptual and special effects sites are the coolest.</p>

<p>I didn't like having to scroll down to get to web or site links. It took me a while, but I finally figured out the method to the madness of three columns. That way I can put in a lot more links and information. I picked the colors pulling samples from our Egyptian Goose mascot. However, I'm not entirely happy with it--specifically the link boxes-- so I'll sit on it for a while to see what will pull it together.</p>

<p>If anyone has constructive criticism on the design, let me know.</p>

<p><b>Close commenting?</b></p>

<p>While I'm talking site design, I'm rather tempted to close off the comments for good. </p>

<p>First, real comments are far and few between as my audience (such as it is) isn't the commenting sort. Second, I'm constantly combating comment spammers. Third, I looked at my site statistics one day and at least a third of my traffic is from spammers.</p>

<p>I've managed to keep spamming to a minimum by closing off any posts older than five days and blacklisting known spam sites and spammers. Yet, why should I bother with someone who only wants one extra hit a day to their online poker or porn site?</p>

<p>What I'm thinking of doing instead is putting up an email link where people can send comments or story ideas. Unless it is a personal note, I'll post the emails in a "mailbag" post.</p>

	<h3>Gotta like Google</h3>
	
	<p>Wired News today outlines why Google's Initial Public Offering is so unusual in it's web article <a title="Wired News: More Reasons to Love Google" href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,63286-2,00.html?tw=wn_story_page_next1">More Reasons to Love Google</a>.</p>

<p>Here's a sampling...<br />
<blockquote>If you take a close look at the form Google filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the exact value of its planned offering is $2,718,281,828 dollars, which some would immediately recognize as the mathematical constant e. E, for those not blessed with a Ph.D. and a job at Google, is Euler's number, which is used as the base for natural logarithms.</blockquote></p>

<p>Along with everyone else, I was worried the IPO would ruin the company as Wall Street has ruined so many other good companies during the tech boom. Some companies deal with the pressure of measuring up to quarterly earning expectations better than others. Those that didn't fudged numbers up the wazoo in the 90s.</p>

<p>But I'm encouraged. Google is flat out telling Wall Street in its <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312504073639/ds1.htm"> IPO statmenet</a> it doesn't want to play the numbers game and prefers to focus on the long-run health of the company and maintaining employees with perks such as free eats (boy that'd be nice).</p>

	<h3>Planety, planety night</h3>
	
	<p>OK, so it doesn't sound as good as stary, stary night, but starting tonight the planets will be the attraction as five planets will be visible in the same sky at one time.</p>

<p>Look around the moon at sunset and you'll find Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Mercury and Saturn (and of course the moon). <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2004/19mar_planets.htm">NASA</a> has the details on this evening sky event.  </p>

<p>Thanks to our friend "Ms. Tree" for passing along the word. We spent one early morning with her in the middle of nowhere lying on the side of a road watching a meteor shower. It was a really foggy night and we found one spot where the sky had a clearing. That was fun!</p>

	<h3>Movable Type delivers visitors?</h3>
	
	<p>For some reason, I decided to look at my site stats. I'm hosted on 1and1.com. I couldn't resist the three-years free offer. It serves me well, but the control panel is still on the slow side so I don't mess with it often.</p>

<p>Today I did and I'm shocked. The traffic to this site has climbed nearly 400 percent two straight months. </p>

<p>I was getting 200-300 unique visitors a month late last year when I was using Blogger. I switched to Movable Type this year and my "circulation" jumped to 800 in January and nearly 2,000 in February.</p>

<p>I attribute this climb to two things. </p>

<p>First I believe I can write a decent headline.</p>

<p>I'm a former journalist with 15 years under my wing. After I left my last newspaper job I quit writing for nearly a year. This blog was an effort to reactivate the muse (as well as letting my mom and family know what's going on in our lives.) </p>

<p>While my writing is slowing improving, I think some of my entries are catching blog readers eyes due to my headlines. The entry "I love CSS, I hate CSS and boy it's cold" spiked my daily readership from an average of 70 to nearly 300. The entry was only about my struggle to learn CSS. Pretty boring actually, thus I can only attribute it to the headline. An entry on Howard Dean similarly tripled my readership.</p>

<p>Second is the pings built into the Movable Type software. Apparently it works. But I'm still amazed that 2,000 have visited in Feburary.</p>

<p>Leave a comment occasionally and say hi. Let me know what you'd like to read. </p>

	<h3>Humans Failing the Turing Test</h3>
	
	<p>Mathematician Alan Turing predicted that when a computer sending text messages could fool humans into thinking they were dealing with another human, that the machine could be called "intelligent."</p>

<p>The BBC website published a rather interesting <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3503465.stm">article</a> on the topic. </p>

<p>The article reminded me of an email that I recently received and thought was from a friend. I opened it and it turned out to be machine generated spam. As the article explains, for a split second, I was fooled by a machine.</p>

<p>But, can you imagine a guy trying for 13 days to get a computer to go on a virtual date with him? <a href="http://foner.www.media.mit.edu/people/foner/Julia/section3_3.html">It's happened.</a></p>

	<h3>I gave up</h3>
	
	<p>so I tried something else fun with CSS. Basically the new webpage has two photos overlaying each other and I get to choose where each peeks out, the original or the "frosted glass" version. The photo is the Ohio River bridge at Madison.</p>

<p>It's a tad gaudy at this point. I'll try to find a photo of something a little less eye-boggling.</p>

	<h3>It figures</h3>
	
	<p>I'm not sure why I'm bothering to learn CSS, nor why I'm getting obsessive in getting this three column layout to work. But leave it to a windows machine to blow my hard work out of the water. On Mac it's looking pretty darn good. On Microsoft's browser it looks awful. Go figure. I'll have to see what it looks like in Mozilla on windows.<br />

	<h3>Happy Happy Joy Joy</h3>
	
	<p>Boy that was quick! </p>

<p>I got home for lunch today to find Darlene laid out on our bed playing with our computer. Our computer! It came back!</p>

<p>Just before lunch Airborne Express dropped off the box with our Apple iBook enclosed. We had just dropped the puppy off at the Cincinnati Apple Store on Friday. They said the turnaround averaged 5-7 days. We're used to people meaning business days so we didn't expect it back until the end of the week at the earliest.</p>

<p>As requested they repaired my modem, power plug and the screen is looking as good as ever! I can open it again without it flicking off! To do all this I know they had to break it into pieces.</p>

<p>Better yet, they not only repaired those three things, but they also did some nice additional work as well.</p>

<p>The period key that broke off my keyboard? Fixed.</p>

<p>The keys my oily, speed-typing fingers rubbed clean? <br />
Replaced.</p>

<p>The little rubber feet on the bottom of the laptop that dropped off two years ago? Replaced.</p>

<p>The trackpad and button corroded by two-and-a-half years of use in a pottery? REPLACED with new! Indeed the whole top panel is brand new.</p>

<p>This computer hasn't looked this good since Jan. 2002. </p>

<p>I should have remembered about the little right speaker being out. I knew I forgot something. But, hey I feel like I got my $300 worth. My computer works again and should last me another year at least.</p>

<p>"Let the surfing begin!" Darlene declared.</p>

	<h3>Computer withdrawl</h3>
	
	<p>Well, our laptop finally bit enough dust that we took it in to be repaired. The cable that lights up the screen is frayed to the point it will only light up if it is within an inch of being closed. Hard to type that way to say the least. So we'll be without our computer for the next week give or take. I still can check email at work on occasion.</p>

<p>Already we're suffering withdrawl symptoms. We have no idea what's going on in the world until the paper comes out the next day! Oh my gosh news that's more than 11 hours old! That's old news!</p>
