	<h3>I'm scritchin a Tiger between the ears</h3>
	
	<p>This morning I starred at the ring of fire and leaped through to Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.</p>

<p>I've been playing with it on and off all a day and it is one sweet cat. I get an educational discount so Tiger only ran me $70, but I'm thinking I'd be happy if I did have to pay $130. Here's my experience so far...</p>

<p><b>Installation</b>: Installation was mostly painless though I did decent amount of preparation to avoid trouble. Here's what I did...</p>

<p>I backed up my user folders, my applications and libraries. At that point I ran out of space on my iPod. I used Onyx to repair permissions, cleared cache and ran the maintenance scripts. Then I ran DiskWarrior and repaired the directories. I double checked whether I needed any new firmware.</p>

<p>Then I bit the bullet and installed Tiger. I was mildly surprised that the default setup simply upgrades the system. You have to chose "options" to choose either an "archive and install" or "erase and install." I chose "archive and install" as it gave me a clean new system folder while still porting over my old settings. The whole process from there was maybe 30 minutes tops.</p>

<p>A few things didn't work off the bat. Norton's doesn't work and Virtual PC needs an minor upgrade. If you go to the <a href="http://www.macintouch.com/tigerreview/">Macintouch</a> website, you'll find a full review including a software compatibility chart. It reported that there were a few security problems and asked if I wanted to fix them. I did, but I honestly don't know what it meant. Even so, the shakeout time was minimal.</p>

<p><b>It's a speedy cat</b>: Once Spotlight, Tiger's new system searching software, finished indexed my hard drive the speed differences became evident. It sounds odd, but everything simply does what it should when it should. There's no lag time. "Crisp" is a good word. </p>

<p>I'm using a Powerbook G4 1.33ghz computer so it's reasonably quick, but under 10.3 it still slugged along occasionally. That's no longer the case. The difference between 10.3 and 10.4 is very noticable. </p>

<p>Apps are faster as well. The new versions of Safari and Mail pack some speed improvements, but I was astounded by the speed change in Firefox. It seems to pull down pages in an instant. iPhoto 5 is a lightyear better than iPhoto 4 under 10.3. The iTunes Music Store downloads pages in a flash under Tiger. All in all, it truly feels like I have high-speed Internet now.</p>

<p><b>Visually interesting</b>: The new video technologies in this build are impressive. The interface can ripple and wave with no apparent hit to the performance. The new Quicktime 7 is beautiful. Quicktime videos have a polish I simply did not expect-- they are crystal clear. If you have a widescreen powerbook or monitor, the QT7 features HD capabilities that will blow you away.</p>

<p>Mind you, there are portions of the interface that I'd almost call ugly, Mail 2.0 for example. Hey you can't win them all.</p>

	<h3>*whew* I'm done. Two week break coming up.</h3>
	
	<p>We'll as of 3:30 p.m. today I was done with the first semester of grad school. Six credits down, 30 credits to go. I turned in my two final projects. I think I did a good job on them. </p>

<p>When I left my last class, I almost would have gone as far as saying I'm not sure what I'd do with myself not having homework hanging over my head for the next two weeks.</p>

<p>Actually, I'll have plenty on my agenda.</p>

<p>This weekend and next my wonderful "muddy" wife is having her pottery studio spring open house. Check the details over at <a href="http://www.mudcatpottery.com">Mudcat Pottery</a>. Yes, I used the same template I created for this website. That may be one of the things I do over break is get some new stuff up on her site and tweak it to give it more of its own personality. I also hope to read a novel or two. There are a couple new mysteries by William Tapply and Tim Cockey I've shelved in the new book section that I'd love to get my hands on. Maybe add a movie or two and some Star Trek.</p>

<p>Of course, our building needs a good cleaning from top to bottom -- I have a month worth of junk on my bedside table that I really need to go through.</p>

<p>I'll finally also have time to play with my computer a bit. My copy of Mac OS X 10.4 "Tiger" arrived in the mail this afternoon and I'm backing up all the files from my computer as I type. I'll install it tomorrow and see if it is as good as people are reporting. There is a rather interesting review on the operating system over at <a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/macosx-10.4.ars">ArsTechnica</a> that delves into every technical detail you could imagine. </p>

<p>Finally, I read the headlines that our state government finally approved Daylight Saving Time for 2006. Now we move the battle to whether we'll be in Eastern or Central time. I'm hoping we'll get to stay in Eastern time, at least in our neck of the woods as I would really hate having it get dark at 4 p.m. in the middle of winter.</p>

<p>That's all the news for Friday, 29 April 2005 (except that the movie version of "Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy" finally opened). Don't Panic.</p>

		<h2>04.23.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Weird April weather</h3>
	
	<p>Driving home from Indianapolis after classes last night was a real experience. </p>

<p>The sky turned green and I can't even begin to describe what the clouds looked like. Sufice it to say that they weren't the usual flat bottomed cumulonimbus.</p>

<p>A minute later all hell broke loose with wind and rain so hard I couldn't see out my windshield. I pulled over and watched the hail bounce all over the place.</p>

<p>I called Darlene on my cell and she told me there were tornado warnings to my east and north. No surprise there.</p>

<p>It finally slowed and I drove home. I passed a ton of cars hiding under overpasses which I could have sworn I heard was the worst thing to do.</p>

<p>About a 40 minutes later the western sky cleared and the setting sun illuminated the treetops. It was unreal. The tree bottoms were still shadowed by the storm clouds, but a sharp line of bright (and I mean bright) green leaves contrasted against a still inky sky. I drove bugeyed through the light rain watching the scene when suddenly a bright double rainbow highlighted the road infront of me. Of course, the rainbow (and the road) ended in Madison.</p>

<p>This morning my father-in-law called. The same storm system is now hitting them and they're expecting 4 inches of snow. Unfortunately, all their fruit trees are in blossom and they're going to lose all the pre-started corn they planted just last week.</p>

<p>March came in like a lion and out like a lamb. April came in like a lamb and is leaving like an angry ram.</p>

		<h2>04.16.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>"Madison" premieres tomorrow</h3>
	
	<p>Jim Caviezel and Jake Lloyd will be in Madison tomorrow for the premiere of "Madison." There will be a red carpet event at our favorite movie palace-- the 1938 art deco Ohio Theatre. </p>

<p>Apparently there is a dress code for the premiere and Darlene told me she heard a few people won't be going after buying tickets because they weren't allowed to wear jeans.</p>

<p>They closed Main Street at noon today and are erecting a block worth of party tents for the after-movie fiesta that comes with the $40 movie tickets. There will apparently be a block party for the "rest of us" on the next block with music playing all evening.</p>

<p>If the party were elsewhere in town I'd skip it and just wait for the movie to open normally on the 22nd. However, it's only a block away so I guess I should wander up the block and check it out.</p>

<p>Mind you, it would be cool to be on the second or third floors of one of the downtown buildings and watch it all from a birds eye view. ahhh, the old reporter's instincts are still there.</p>

		<h2>04.11.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Madison...the movie</h3>
	
	<p>Well, after many years of waiting, "Madison" the movie will finally premiere in our wonderful rivertown this weekend and on April 22 will be released in cities around the country that understand hydroplane racing. If it suceeds there, it will spread to other markets.</p>

<p>I just posted a "skyscrapper" ad on my site so you can enter a contest for a free boat and watch the latest trailer. It's a pretty good trailer and you get glimpses of our rivertown. </p>

<p>The movie was shot here in town a few years back. I did some coverage of it for the newspaper and for a very long afternoon I was an extra on the set. I doubt I'll make it as I heard they decided to reshoot the scenes I was in (a pancake fundraiser scene).</p>

<p>I did meet many of the actors include Jake Lloyd (Star Wars I) and his family. There is a scene in the movie where he is biking down the boat ramp. I took some photos for the paper and talked to him just before he shot the scene. Ironically, his sister's name is Madison (which apparently is now the second most popular girl's name in the country).</p>

<p>The town certainly left an impression on the cast and crew. Indeed, on completing the movie, one of the top crewmembers decided to leave Los Angeles and move here. She now runs a shop on Main Street called <a href="http://www.theprincessandthebead.com">Princess and the Bead</a>.</p>

		<h2>04.10.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>The coming oil crash?</h3>
	
	<p>I take every "doomsday scenarios" with a certain amount of caution as it is hard to sift out good science from junk science. It is harder today with interest groups purposefully introducing junk science or junk reasoning to undermine the real thing.</p>

<p>That said, for some strange reason, I'm suddenly running into a slew of articles about "peak oil" and  the impact to society when we run out of cheap oil. Here's one from <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/_/id/7203633">Rolling Stone</a> magazine I read last night.</p>

<p>Essentially, so many of our "necessities" rely on cheap oil that when it is no longer affordable civilization as we know it will start a slow but definite crash.</p>

<p>Necessities? Obviously our transportation system, but also a slew of industries we consider mandatory from plastics and pharmaceuticals to nearly our entire agricultural system. Without cheap oil all of this will be impacted.</p>

<p>The problem is how do you extrapolate the future? Is it inevitable? Could forward thinking slow or reverse the decline?</p>

<p>I'm obviously not sure, but one thing does seem certain, things will change and we're not talking about it.l</p>

		<h2>04.09.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Spring fever</h3>
	
	<p>It's a beautiful day in good old Madison, Indiana. You can look down the streets and see pink and white blossoms and verdant new leaves poking out of the branches.</p>

<p>I'm doing homework and Darlene mudding the drywall in her new kiln room. She also received her new Peter Pugger de-airing pugmill which mixes, recycles and prepares clay. In go scraps (wet or dry) and out comes fresh, ready to use clay. Amazing.</p>

<p>Three more weeks and the semester is over and I'll have six grad credits under my belt-- 16% towards an MLS.</p>

<p>At the library we're getting ready for our National Library Week events. The top event is probably a professional poetry reading. The local poet has created a new program that will be premiering in New York City next month. We're also going to make our wireless network available to the public as well.</p>

<p>That's life, the universe and everything. May your spring day be as pretty as ours.<br />

		<h2>04.02.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>A day late and a fastball short</h3>
	
	<p>Darlene yesterday kept telling me I had to read about the greatest sports April Fools' Day joke ever. I didn't get to it until a few minutes ago, but she's right-- it's a gem.</p>

<p>Thus I present to you (a day late) a great read from The New York Times: <a title="The New York Times > Sports > Baseball > An Old Baseball April Fools' Hoax" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/01/sports/baseball/01finch.html?8hpib=&pagewanted=all&position=">An Old Baseball April Fools' Hoax</a> (Free registration required).</p>

<p>It now ranks right up there with the Silver Lake Sea Serpant as my favorite alltime hoax. Sidd Finch lives!<br />
