	<h3>"Knowledge for Sale: Why American libraries are in trouble"</h3>
	
	<p>[<b>Updated</b>: Utne street librarian Chris Dodge today sent me the links to the articles. Also minor edits]</p>

<p>The July/August issue of Utne magazine features an article by "street librarian" Chris Dodge entitled "Knowledge for sale: Why American libraries are in trouble."</p>

<p>If you want to know what the left thinks about libraries, I consider this a must read article. <a href="http://www.utne.com/magazine/newsstand/utne130_knowledge-for-sale.pdf">Knowledge for Sale</a> (also <a href="http://www.utne.com/magazine/newsstand/utne130_monastic-librarians.pdf">Monastic Librarians</a>). From an academic standpoint, there's not a ton of depth, but it's very interesting nonetheless.</p>

<p>He hit on some interesting issues, some of which I struggle with myself at my library-- specifically issues on purchasing and cataloging. I agree with him on both issues. Here are his thoughts and my thoughts...</p>

<p>On purchasing... </p>

<p>If we continue to move toward the demand-model of material selection and/or outsourse the selection process, Dodge argues the collections will become skewed to the popular and mass appeal. As a result, we ignore the minority communities or minority interests. I wholeheartedly agree, though I think people have come to expect the demand model from libraries. </p>

<p>At our library I do some AV purchasing and subscribed to the Film Movement series from Recorded Books. I like it because we now have same access to award-winning films in little ol' Madison as the hot shots in New York and LA. It's a total of 12 DVDs a year, not a large number considering I order at least 180 DVDs a year. </p>

<p>While a number of people have told me they liked the series, one person wrote in our annual survey (paraphased) "stop buying all that foreign junk."  After some thought I concluded the problem wasn't one of an an imbalanced collection, but rather all the popular titles I've purchased are constantly in circulation so you have to show up at exactly the right time (or put them on hold) to snag them. As a result, the collection certainly looks skewed to the obtuse. I think I'll create a paper catalog of DVD titles as people rarely bother to search the catalog to see if we have a title.</p>

<p>On Cataloging... </p>

<p>Dodge also wrote how our standardized catalog systems are unintuitive, severely hampering access to materials.</p>

<p>Having taken "bibliographic access and control" I certainly understand the need for standardization. Obviously, a catalog without controlled vocabulary and name/subject authority is obviously chaos.</p>

<p>However, I'd definitely consider myself a Sandynista. Dodge wrote about the work of Hennepin County (minn.) cataloger Sandy Berman who, through extensive bibliographic record notes and alternative titles and subjects, created a catalog that was very user friendly. Unfortunately, in the name of standardization, the library system reversed his work after he retired. I think that's a sickening shame. </p>

<p>We have a generally easy to use online catalog (Sirsi iBistro), but it is severely lacking in that is has no capabilities to share sees/see alsos. Thus the only way to get around this is to do a Berman-style bibliographic record. (although it'd obviously be better for Sirsi and other search engines to get their act together).</p>

<p>Similarly, authors have to be types in "last name, first name" yet there are no obvious "tips" on the page to tell anyone that.  A person can go away thinking we have absolutely no books on a topic of interest.</p>

<p>Similarly, our library is now in the process of starting a second digital library. On the first I argued we needed alternative catagories as noone will type in dwellings when they are searching for photos of "Madison homes." I was overruled by a very experienced and very wise cataloger who stressed we needed to stick with standards. I am grateful to her as starting off on the right foot and doing the project "right" has helped us get a federal grant to do a second digital library. </p>

<p>This new project is one of the first in the Indiana Digital Library project that aims to create digital projects that can be shared so they can be "harvested" by search engines. Standardization is a must for this to work, yet the problem of "will a person search using LC subject terms?" still exists. </p>

<p>A number of us agreed at a workshop sponsored by the Indiana State Library that we needed to include alternative subjects in addition to official "LC" subject terms. </p>

<p>This whole debate obviously opens a whole can of worms, but I think it's one that needs to be opened. Fried worms anyone?</p>

<p>Here are two links...</p>

<p><a href="http://madison-jeffco.cdm.oclc.org">The Lemen Collection</a></p>

<p>This is the first digital library the Madison-Jefferson County Public Library did. I was in charge of the tech side of the project, scanning and customizing the web templates to fit our desires.</p>

<p><a href="http://openstacks.net/os/archives/000732.html#000732">Open Stacks #1</a></p>

<p>This is the first podcast of Open Stacks by my friend Greg Schwartz. His premiere episode delves deeply into Adam Mathes' paper on folksonomies. If you're interested in cataloging I think you'd find the podcast (an mp3 audio file) to be fascinating.</p>

	<h3>Madison in spring album</h3>
	
	<p>It's a couple months late, but I finally have time to post some more photos. Once again these are some photos Darlene took. She's pretty much commendeered the camera.</p>

<p>Either way, we're dedicating this album to Nathan and Anne, a truly wonderful couple from Dallas, Texas, we met yesterday. They are considering a move to the most beautiful rivertown in America and were quizzing us. Yet we found many commonalities that led to four hours of fun conversation. We hope to someday have them as neighbors.</p>

<p>--Hope y'all had a safe drive home and here are some photos to hold you over.</p>

	<h3>*whew*</h3>
	
	<p>I don't think I have EVER done that much homework in such a short time. I was told summer sessions were intense, but I never expected this.</p>

<p>In the last week of my class I gave a 7-minute presentation, wrote a 6-page report, a 10-page journal, a group project on budgeting and evaluations of my teammates and myself. I did classwork from Friday-Monday basically non-stop. </p>

<p>Nonetheless I survived and I'm on vacation until Monday.</p>

<p>Even though I'm exhausted, I was suffering cabin fever and my mom is in town so we took off and partied a little in Louisville -- Carmichael's Books, Half-Price Books and a really cook new pottery gallery/supply shop at 1806 Frankfort Ave. With that break I now feel like I'm done.</p>

<p>We'll hang out around town for a couple of days and then take off for Chicago for the American Library Association annual conference on Saturday. We're planning on going to "The Stacks" the exhibition portion of the conference which I hear is quite an experience. I'm looking forward to visiting the new Graphic Novel section as I'm definitely a comics addict (I think I'm up to 65 strips a day-- a hard habit it is).</p>

<p>Wow... vacation. I might even have time to blog.</p>

	<h3>Help save NPR and PBS</h3>
	
	<p>If you like public television or public radio, now is the time to act as the House of Representatives is planning to slash the budget. <a href="www.moveon.org">MoveOn.org</a> is rallying to protect PBS and NPR from budget cuts through a petition on which they hope to get 1 million signatures.</p>

<p>When I was attending college at Miami University, I worked in the news department of the public radio station WMUB. The experience was by far the best journalism experience I ever had. When I found a story, they gave me the air time to tell it right. You just can't find that anywhere else on the radio dial. </p>

<p>Why do I favor public funding for NPR? Radio media today is highly consolidated supported by and subservient to its advertisers. There are certainly a number of really good stations that don't let ad dollars interfere with its reporting, but if you want news that serves you public radio is the place to get it. </p>

<p>PBS speaks for itself as the number of kids who have learned courtesies and their letters and numbers from Seseme St. is incalculable. Schools across the nation use PBS programming in their lesson plans.</p>

<p>The bottom line is this is valuable to me. I believe it makes our communities stronger. I encourage you to sign this <a href="http://www.moveon.org">petition</a>. It should be the top link on the page.</p>

<p><b>Sidenote</b>: These kinds of cuts were considered in 1995 and a similar petition was circulated. However, once the threat subsided, the petition continued to circulate and it was soon labeled as a hoax. However, this is real and the vote will take place in the next few days. That's why I'm linking only to the homepage of Moveon.org. If the petition is not the top link on the page, it's too late for this round.<br />

	<h3>Podcasts I listen to</h3>
	
	<p>I've added a podcast category to my links list at right. Every Friday during my drive to Indianapolis for class I listen to the past week's podcasts. Without my iPod and these programs my trip would be much less bareable.</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.openstacks.net/os/" target="_blank"><b>Open Stacks</b></a>: Friend Greg Schwartz, a librarian at the Louisville Free Public Library, does this podcast about library and information science topics. Every other week he takes the news of note, gives us the background and his personal thoughts. Each of his 13 episodes has had something I found either interesting or though provoking. If libraries are your thing, this is a must listen.</li>
<li> <a href="http://escape.extraneous.org/" target="_blank"><b>Escape Pod</b></a>: I don't know how I stumbled upon this new podcast, but it is certainly a blast. Traditionally, cutting edge science fiction had been written in short story form. However, in part due to the dumping of bad work on the market, the format has dropped out of favor. This podcast hopes to bring the format back to life, reading a new short sci-fi story each week.</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.maccast.com/" target="_blank"><b>The MacCast</b></a>: News for Mac Geek by Mac Geeks. Adam reads the Apple news of the day and contributes analysis. Other members of the MacCast community contribute audio comments, reviews and questions. I usually only listen to the news in the opening of the program, but sometimes the other stuff is pretty good too.</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/" target="_blank"><b>On the Media</b></a>: This is a National Public Radio program posted every Friday by WNYC in New York. This is a great program that doesn't flinch in its efforts to make sense of today's media world. I find it fascinating both as a former journalist and current political junkie</li>

	<h3>Dean's truthtelling not settling well with Demo insiders</h3>
	
	<p>Here's a recent quote from Howard Dean...<br />
<blockquote><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2005/06/07/MNdean07.TMP">(Dean) said in San Francisco this week</a> that Republicans are "a pretty monolithic party. They all behave the same. They all look the same. It's pretty much a white Christian party."</p>

<p>"The Republicans are not very friendly to different kinds of people," Dean said Monday, responding to a question about diversity during a forum with minority leaders and journalists. "We're more welcoming to different folks, because that's the type of people we are. But that's not enough. We do have to deliver on things: jobs and housing and business opportunities."<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>In the past couple of days a number of Democratic elected officials and leaders have growled at Dean for the statement. In part because all that is being reported is that Dean said Republicans "are pretty much a white Christian party."</p>

<p>If Dean made a mistake here it was possibly leaving out the word "leadership" after Republican, because that's who he's talking about. </p>

<p>Consider this. "Of the 3,643 Republicans serving in the state legislatures, <a href="http://americablog.blogspot.com/2005/06/oops-gop-really-is-all-white-study.html">only 44 are minorities</a>, or 1.2 percent." White? Yes. Is the Christian right driving the Republican social policy? Yes.</p>

<p>The truth is that the GOP is run by the Christian right on social issues and by corporate libertarians on economic issues. These people don't want a "voice" in a democrary. They don't even want to be the majority in a democracy. They want to rule-- lock, stock and barrel.</p>

<p>I give Dean tons of credit for trying to tell people we are heading toward a plutocratic theocracy-- one that is oddly unChrist-like.</p>

<p>Yet, we are in a time where this political truth telling can get your head chopped off by the GOP machine and the Democratic leadership is still clearly afraid of this buzz saw. If we can't find a way of telling America the political truth of what we face, how can we possibly win in 2006 or ever?</p>

<p>So to the Democratic leaders who are chewing on Dean I have this to say... if you don't like hearing Dean tell the truth, you better figure a better way of doing it yourself.</p>

<p><b>Afterword</b>: I did read an article that the D.C. Democratic gang is angry because Dean is ignoring the Democratic corporate fatcats when it comes to fundraising. </p>

<p>Dean is actually doing an awesome job of raising money-- we're nearly doubling our off-year fundraising records (though Republicans are still outraising us 2:1). However, most of this money is being raised through small donations and, to make it worse (to insiders eyes), the money is being given to state parties. </p>

<p>This is actually genius because it is at the state level that the Democrats are having the most luck and that can only ripple into the national ranks. Yet, the Washington establishment appears to be flinching at the notion and a few people are wondering if this isn't a reason the establishment wants to take out Dean.</p>

	<h3>Yesterday? homework. Today? homework. Tomorrow?</h3>
	
	<p>Well, tomorrow is class, but the day after that will be homework too.</p>

<p>I'm coming up on the end of my first summer session and I'm amazed at how much information is being squeezed into the short space. Having taken two 16-week courses and now one six-week course-- I'd prefer quarters over semesters and summer sessions. I think the class is going pretty well, though I'm behind on the reading (what else is new). </p>

<p>Unfortunately, Mother Nature is not helping me much here. </p>

<p>We managed to get air conditioning in our building for the first time just as it hit 94.8 her downtown this week. However, I'd love to know what tree, mold or mite is doing me in. I'm having an extreme allergic reaction to something. I'm wanting to tear my eyes out and it feels like I'm breathing hot sands into my lungs.</p>

<p>Some prescription eye drops I had left over from last summer's allergy attack helped, but Claritin wasn't doing the trick so I went in to see the doctor today.</p>

<p>He didn't tell me anything I didn't already know-- I'm joining the thousands who are suffering from the Ohio River Valley Crud. ORVC is a catch-all malady that is suffered at vaying times of year by valley residents. It typifies the valley as a cauldron of allergies and sinus junk. </p>

<p>Mind you, I didn't like the prescription-- my insurance charged me $40 for Zyrtec-D and I have to take corticosteroid hormone junk for my lungs starting in the morning. While I really didn't like the side effect from the last time I had to take the stuff, I'll take that over not breathing. It's indeed like the billboard about asthma, it is kind of like being a fish out of water.</p>
