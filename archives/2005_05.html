	<h3>Wanderlust and Memorial Day weekend</h3>
	
	<p>When Darlene and I were in college we wandered just about every road in western Ohio. Once we got out of college, other than vacation, we lost the wanderlust.</p>

<p>But now that I'm driving back and forth to Indy every week I've regained my wanderlust. There's only so many times you can drive down I-65 without getting sick of it. There's just something satisfying about being on the road not yet traveled.</p>

<p>As a result I'm finding about every way to drive from Indy to Madison. So far I'd say my favorite is Indiana 3 between Greensburg and North Vernon. It was a very "springy-Hoosierish" day. Barns sitting out in deep green rolling fields. Just nice.</p>

<p>After class on Friday, we went to visit Darlene's family near Lima, Ohio, for the holiday. We drove up from Indy to Marion and then went straight east through the flat farmlands of eastern Indiana. The fields were huge, going from the road back at least a mile in every direction before you hit a stand of trees. Wheat fields are starting to grow.</p>

<p>We crossed into Ohio going over the Wabash River (yes Hoosiers, it starts in Ohio) and over to Grand Lake St. Mary's. The largest inland lake in Ohio, it was created to be the resevoir for the Miami-Erie Canal. The lake is an impossible blue. I'd only seen photos that blue somewhere in the Caribbean. The lake is flanked by Celina and St. Mary's, Both are nice towns. Celina is the resort town of the two with nice homes and condos line the lake. St. Mary's was the canal town with fragments of the Miami-Erie still flowing through town.</p>

<p>It's great to wander. It helps cures the urge to runaway from home when I need to be studying.</p>

<p>The weekend has been fun. I have managed to get a chunk of reading for class done, but we've also done a good share of partying with her family.</p>

<p>We went to a "school's out for summer" party at Darlene's sister's house and helped watch about 40 kids party. Two of her sister's kids are in a hard rock garage band and heard them play last night. Of course, they were indeed playing in the garage. They were really good considering the oldest was only 15.</p>

<p>Today about half the family came out to her parents' house. Two of my brothers-in-law and I played a couple hours of frisbee golf. Here's a typical hole for us... We'd start from the bed of Stan's pickup truck, throw down across the back field into a dried pond, back across the barley field and into the compost bin, back up the field and into the corn wagon bin finally tosing the frisbee through the front window of the pickup to complete the hole. I had a 15 on that hole. We didn't play a par anything the whole game.</p>

<p>Toss in a really moist turkey and two pretty decent car races and it's a been a pretty good Memorial Day weekend. Mind you I have another chunk of homework before we'll head home tomorrow.</p>

	<h3>Welcome to the police state?</h3>
	
	<p>This is ugly.. really ugly. (But stay tuned to the end, because I'll toss in a cute aside to make up for the pain)...</p>

<p>The American Civil Liberties Union is reporting that the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is planning to vote on a greatly expanded Patriot Act. The kicker, they're allegedly going to do this in a closed secret meeting. </p>

<p>That alone is anti-democracy, but it's no wonder they are doing it behind closed doors-- the bill is outright scary. Here's the part that gauls me as a future librarian...<br />
<blockquote>The bill would grant so-called "administrative subpoena" authority to the FBI, letting the bureau write and approve its own search orders for any tangible thing it deems relevant to an intelligence investigation without approval. This power would let agents seize personal records from medical facilities, libraries, hotels, gun dealers, banks and any other business, without having to appear before a judge, and without any evidence that the people whose records are swept in are involved in any criminal activity.</blockquote></p>

<p>Without any checks whatsoever, we might as well rename the FBI the KGB.</p>

<p>Here are some ACLU links:<br />
*<a href="http://www.aclu.org/SafeandFree/SafeandFree.cfm?ID=18313&c=206">Senate Intelligence Committee Examines Controversial Patriot Act Expansion Bill; Closed Door Vote to Be Held This Week</a></p>

<p>*<a href="http://www.aclu.org/SafeandFree/SafeandFree.cfm?ID=18298&c=206">ACLU Memo to Interested Persons Regarding Analysis of Senate Intelligence Committee Patriot Act Reauthorization Bill</a></p>

<p><b>Now for the cute that I promised</b>... We have workgroups in my library management class and my teammate Elsa sent me a link for <a href="http://www.storewars.org">Store Wars</a>. It's a very smart and timely parody of the original Star Wars comparing organic foods to your usual grocery aisle goods. It's cute as a cucumber...</p>

	<h3>filibuster deal: could be better, could be worse</h3>
	
	<p>In the days prior to homework I'd have known about the filibuster deal immediately. Instead I learned about it nearly four hours later... I'm slipping.</p>

<p>In the world that the Senate should be and has been practiced for umpteen decades, there wouldn't be a question about the filibuster. Both parties have used it to keep the wingers out of posts. The filibuster is honorable and a sound way of protecting the minority voice in the Senate. A filibuster allows for individuals in the august body to have their say, yet also puts their entire party on the line. </p>

<p>If the Repugs wanted to pick on rules to change-- it should be the committee chairman that won't even bring a nomination before their committtee. The difference is one person blocking a process versus 40+ senators blocking a process.</p>

<p>The Democrats should not have had to make a compromise on such a basic tradition. Yet, when you're down by 10 votes and the right wingers are hellbent for domination you do what you can do to survive until the next election and hope that one's not fixed.</p>

<p>Still, what president has EVER had 95 percent of their appointees approved? What president or party has EVER had the gaul to assume they'd get 100 percent approval?</p>

	<blockquote>Did I tell you about the scare I had over my cat recently? She'd gotten out and I thought she'd gotten pregnant, but as it turns out, she had merely eaten a whole ball of yarn. And then she had mittens.</blockquote>

<p>I could only wish to be this good at puns. He had me hook, line and sinker.</p>

	<h3>A new morality for the 21st century?</h3>
	
	<p>For my library management class I'm reading an interesting book called "Civic Librarianship" by Ronald B. McCabe. </p>

<p>McCabe argues that the libertarian trends of the 60s-mid 90s created a nation where communities and civic institutions have been reduced to business models with no moral authority to help society. Libraries, schools and newspapers, for examples, are no longer educators and protectors of our civic society, but simple purveyors of information.</p>

<p>This in turn causes management and the public to devalue the civic professionals such as teachers, librarians and journalists. The library world is screaming at these trends--Philadelphia, for example, has been planning to reduce numerous branches to "express libraries" staffed only with paraprofessionals. The reasoning? Who needs professional librarians in a world where libraries are becoming nothing more than glorified bookstores?</p>

<p>McCabe argues this trend started in the 1960s when counter-culture rebeled against the "moral" authority of authority. In the 1980s, the right joined in on the fun and tossed in an economic libertariansim that not only eliminated much of the moral checks and balances of business, but in turn forced civic institutions to follow business-oriented models of operation.</p>

<p>I'm just under half way through the book so I haven't read too many of his "solutions," but it revolves around the notion that society needs to regain it's shared "morality" that emphasizes a balance between rights and responsiblities-- both socially and economic.</p>

<p>I admit that when it comes to talk of "morality," my fears ask the question "whose morality?" Nonetheless, I think he is correct.</p>

<p>He uses another author's analogy of society as a mosiac. The pieces are all individual and that individuality is not lost. However, there is a frame and a glue that keep the pieces together and creates something bigger than the pieces. The glue is "shared" morality and the frame is community. </p>

<p>This all makes good sense, but the key is obviously the word "shared." While there are indeed morals the supermajority of the public could agree on, we are now in a climate where some of the shards would rather cut us than become a part of the mosiac.</p>

<p>I'll follow up when I read more of the book. I'm curious how the "community movement" could equal a new "civic librarianship."</p>

		<h2>05.12.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>It darn well took them long enough...</h3>
	
	<blockquote>C reported on his recent talks in Washington. There was a perceptible shift in attitude. Military action was now seen as inevitable. Bush wanted to remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy. The NSC had no patience with the UN route, and no enthusiasm for publishing material on the Iraqi regime's record. There was little discussion in Washington of the aftermath after military action.</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1593607,00.html">--From the secret Downing St. memo. 23 July 2002</a></p>

<p>Since the runup to Iraq War there were complaints about the intelligence being cherry picked to pave the way toward war.</p>

<p>Casual indications said they were right. The Niger yellowcake story fell apart. The former treasury secretary reporting that Bushies were planning war against Iraq within weeks of Inauguration. U.S. government confirmation that there were no weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<p>Finally, on 1 May 2005 The Times of London dropped  a bombshell in the form of a secret British memo (linked above) by a foreign Blair foreign policy aide. </p>

<p>The memo, minutes from a high-level British policy meeting, stated that evidence for war was being fixed.  Amazing isn't it? </p>

<p>The story was huge internationally, but until today it seemed only the Knight-Ridder papers had picked up on the story.</p>

<p>Today, in response to 89 Democratic house members demanding an explanation did CNN <a title="CNN.com - Bush asked to explain UK war memo - May 11, 2005" href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/05/11/britain.war.memo/index.html">finally cover the story</a>-- 10 days later. Indeed, the Democratic letter was released on May 6.</p>

<p>WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE THEY SITTING ON THEIR HANDS FOR? The corporate conservative media is at it again.</p>

<p>What amazes me was that not only did the memo nail the fixing of intelligence, but the fact we were telling the British war was inevitable before Bush told the American people that it wasn't.</p>

<p>It's not enough to impeach Bush, but it certainly is enough for me to lay the blood of tens of thousands at his feet. I'm sick of the lies and I'm sick of a media that won't ask questions.</p>

	<h3>It's official</h3>
	
	<p>I finally got my official grades and I got a pair of As to start off my grad school career. </p>

<p>When I first started thinking about grad school everyone told me I'd do fine. Yet when I read the grading scale I admit I was intimidated. I knew I'd get better than a B, but I never imagined As. I guess I need to stop underestimating myself. ey?<br />
     <br />
<blockquote><br />
A (4.0)         Outstanding achievement.  Student performance demonstrates full command of the course materials and evidences a high level of originality and/or creativity that far surpasses course expectations.  The grade of A+ is not granted in SLIS, except in very exceptional cases.</p>

<p>A- (3.7)        Excellent achievement.  Student performance demonstrates thorough knowledge of course materials and exceeds course expectations by completing all requirements in a superior manner.</p>

<p>B+ (3.3.)      Very good work.  Student performance demonstrates above-average comprehension of the course materials and exceeds course expectations on all tasks as defined in the course syllabus.</p>

<p>B (3.0)         Good work. Student performance meets designated course expectations, demonstrates understanding of the course materials, and performs at an acceptable level.<br />
