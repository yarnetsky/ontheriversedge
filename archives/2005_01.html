	<h3>Election Eve</h3>
	
	<p>[<b>blogger's note</b>: Here's Darlene's take on the night before Iraq's so-called election.]</p>

<p>I have heard a lot of awful news coming out of Iraq lately.  The story of the station wagon with an entire family inside who for some reason (perhaps didn't hear the soldiers shout) didn't stop immediately at a checkpoint and the parents in the front seat were killed. Don't know if any of you saw the photo of the young girl covered in her parents' blood.  A horrible thing, war.  This is a very real result of it.  I have read estimates that up to 100,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed since this began.  The destruction of cities is rampant as well. Even in Bagdad they do not yet have reliable electricity and water.</p>

<p>Tomorrow the Iraqis are to vote in elections.  Our president says he anticipates "a grand moment in Iraqi's history."  But the situation is hardly ideal.  Insurgents have been blowing up polling places, election workers are being killed, and the populace is faced with the choice of risking their lives to cast a ballot.  (often being threatened to be killed if they do and if they do not go to the polls) And many Iraqis see themselves as living in an occupied country.  </p>

<p>I am fearful of what may occur tomorrow to the Iraqi citizens, to our soldiers, and to the innocent children who are so often caught in the crossfire.  Our president has been urging the Iraqis to vote.  I feel he is so bent on making a name for himself in history that he has put himself and his agenda above the safety of the countless soldiers and citizens in danger.  Make no mistake, Iraq is a war zone, and many sections of Iraq are NOT in control of the soldier or the interim Iraqi government. [<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/27/international/middleeast/27baghdad.html?pagewanted=all&position=">Across Bagdad, Security is Only an Ideal</a>] This was easily shown by the bombing of the American embassy today. While free elections sounds like a wonderful goal, it is unconscionable to risk the lives of so many in a country where so many other basic needs are left unmet.</p>

<p>May we all pray that tomorrow is not a nightmare as those polling places open.  The U.S. has enough blood on it's hands.</p>

	<h3>Paying for the coronation</h3>
	
	<p>The more I read about it, the more the Bush coronation on Jan. 20 just gauls me. The fact $40 million dollars was spent on it is amazing -- that's a heck of a lot of political favors being bought. </p>

<p>Yet on the front pages of global newspapers, this extravagance contrasted poorly to photo of a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/picture_gallery/05/middle_east_shooting_in_tal_afar/html/3.stm">little Iraqi girl</a> splattered in her parents blood after her parents were killed by Americans at a check point. Is this a way to win hearts and minds? "Partying American's kill little girls parents?" Here's a <a href="http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/fwis/">Catholic nun's</a> take on the story.</p>

<p>[Mind you, from what I've heard so far the soldiers were in a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. When you have a vehicle that won't stop for a checkpoint, even after warning shots, what do you do? Even shooting at the tires could give a driver time to explode the vehicle. Yet, more of this hell is sure to come. Proof in point? Hundreds of Iraqi police uniforms were stolen in Basra. Would you stop for anyone not knowing who the good guys were?]</p>

<p>Then I read that the local governments are being <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A33804-2005Jan24.html">forced to pay</a> $12 million for the inauguration's extraordinary security. How are the locals supposed to pay for this unfunded federal mandate? The government is saying the locals should use money granted to them for homeland security. Money already earmarked for projects to make us safer. Hearing this do you think residents of Fairfax Co., Va., or Prince George's Co., Md., are feeling safer now?</p>

<p>Yes, it's arguable that Bush deserved to party, but couldn't he have done it in a way that projects just a bit of compassion or maybe in a way that kept these homeland security fund going to projects that actually make those residents safer? Nah, that's not their style.</p>

	<h3>Soundtracks, iPods and Cyborgs</h3>
	
	<p>I was recently emailing Greg (of <a href="http://www.openstacks.net/os">Open Stacks</a> blog-podcast fame) about movie soundtracks. From that email, lets follow a chain of casual connections...</p>

<p>Neither of us have much affection for movie soundtracks. The beasts are often cobbled together spin-offs just to make more money. Heck, half the songs on the soundtrack can't even be found on the film anymore.</p>

<p>There are exceptions to the rule, often when the soundtrack transcends the film itself. The soundtrack to "Young Einstein," is my favorite case in point. </p>

<p>The movie was a super low budget comedy written, directed, produced and starring Australian actor <a href="http://www.yahooserious.com">Yahoo Serious</a>. It imagines Albert Einstein growing up as a Tasmanian, discovering his theory of relativity while brewing beer and romancing Marie Curie while trying to keep his theories from being used to make atomic bombs. </p>

<p>Stopping to read reviews of the movie, I find myself wondering why I remember enjoying it. Hey, it was 15 years ago. However, a more likely reason is the soundtrack.</p>

<p>While "Young Einstein" became one of the biggest films to come out of Australia and achieved some cult status, the soundtrack did even better selling more than 2 million copies. The album is chock full of cool Australian rock from groups like the Saints, Paul Kelly, Big Pig, Icehouse and the Lime Spiders. I listened to the cassette I don't know how many times until it died from a case of sun stroke on the dashboard of our car.</p>

<p>Similarly, I'll admit that I can't listen to Simple Minds' "Don't You Forget About Me" without thinking about the movie "The Breakfast Club" (and on occasion the fact the movie was my first real date with my first high school love.)</p>

<p>Thus through connections to life, soundtracks can chronical time as much as the movie itself.</p>

<p>So, if you were a cyborg, would you have all the music of your lifetime stored in your brain so you could replay it like the soundtrack of your life?</p>

<p>It's arguable that us iPod owners, with anywhere from 512mb to 60gb of music at our fingertips, already have our life's soundtrack at our fingertips and piping into our brains via white earbuds. </p>

<p>Indeed, I've read complaints to that effect. Soundtracks play in the background of the film, sometimes, but rarely advancing the plotline. Critics claim iPods play nothing more than background music to life.  They argue that we really don't enjoy music as it was intended (we shuffle instead of listening to albums straight through). We're not reaching out for new musical experiences, creating playlists of our favorite songs (memories). To top it off, we're not even listening to the real music as it's stuffed with lossy 128mb MP3s -- pixelated versions of the real uncompressed tracks. (Boy that sounds like a government conspiracy). </p>

<p>But a tech marketing guru thinks it's going beyond that. He argues that when we start using the iPods to store our files, our calendar reminders, our music and our contacts, it becomes an extension of ourselves. (What's that phone number? let me check my iPod contacts list).  Thus what difference does it make if this extension is in our pocket or in our brains. We're now cyborgs.</p>

<p>It's an interesting argument. Read more: <a title="Wired News: My IPod, My Self" href="http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,66426,00.html?tw=rss.MAC">Wired My IPod, My Self</a> at Wired.com<br />

		<h2>01.28.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Grad school week three</h3>
	
	<p>My cataloging class is now delving into the book description details of the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules. The professor this morning went over practically each rule. This was the stuff I was having trouble getting through as I was reading so I thanked her for the review.</p>

<p>Her response? "There's no way I could tell everyone just to read chapters one and two without reviewing it. It doesn't make any sense." Thank God I'm not the only one.</p>

<p>Actually, once it's all explained it does make sense. I've learned enough that I could now create a catalog card using the International Standard Bibliographic Description for a pretty straight forward book. Details relating to the cataloging of books are coming next week.</p>

<p>Doing MARC (machine readable catalog) records and subject terms could be another story. Our final project is to create full MARC records on 10 books of her chosing. I spent a couple hours photo copying title pages and preliminaries and tech reading the volumes this afternoon. I'll dive into them over the next few weeks.</p>

<p>My collection development professor is giving a talk in Richmond commemorating the final segregated American Libraries Association meeting. After the experience in 1936, the ALA swore never to hold another convention in a segregated city again. Definitely ahead of the curve.</p>

<p>Either way, because of that she taped her lecture so I'll listen to it tomorrow morning. The video will probably be minimal as it is intended to be viewable over a 56K modem.</p>

<p>When you drive four hours in a day you have plenty of thoughts<br />
--<b>Iraq</b>: Old news to anyone paying attention, but I have to agree with Sy Hersh, we're not really fighting insurgents. We're still fighting Sadam Hussain's guys-- didn't it strike you that we "won" Bagdad a little too easy?<br />
--<b>No on Gonzalez</b>: Any attorney who believes the president should be able to break or ignore whatever law he feels is wrong has no business being in the Justice Department. Someone who in essence condones torture has no right being attorney general.<br />
--<b>bad jokes</b>: During the first week of classes I heard someone pronounce SLIS (school of library and information sciences) for the first time. I had always said it S.L.I.S. (like A.L.A. and F.B.I.). She pronounced it "sliss." I said it was awful, but the first thing that popped in my head was a bad joke. "What do you call a female library sciences student? Slis Miss." Today, I saw her again and she told me she told the joke to several of her friends who had a good laugh. Go figure.<br />
--<b>Podcasting</b>: Could podcasting could bring broadcasting to the masses. A friend-fellow librarian, blogged out, has now started podcasting.<br />
--<b>Apple</b>: Pages sounds pretty cool, but v1.0 quirky. iPod shuffles at Wal-Mart? Yuck!<br />
--<b>Sunrises</b>: No wonder farmers want to get out at the crack of dawn. Hoosier sunrises, when the clouds are just right, are downright beautiful. Pinks, oranges and blues bubbling over horizon. I was a challenge to keep my eyes on the road.</p>

<p>There's more, but it's time to sleep. We left at 6:45 and got home at 9:15 p.m. Boy what a long day (it could have been shorter, but we got lost in what one nurse at University Hospital calls the "gerbil tubes".)</p>

	<h3>Back from the dead</h3>
	
	<p>It was a stupid mistake.</p>

<p>Darlene and I received new debit cards recently. They had the same numbers so I didn't think anything of it. Until a few days ago when we were locked out of our webserver, our email, my blog-- all suddenly nonexistent.</p>

<p>It turns out I forgot to update the expiration date. They cut me off for a bill of $5.88.</p>

<p>Obviously, that's been corrected.</p>

<p>Meanwhile life is suddenly becoming a soap opera.</p>

<p>--One of our friends is undergoing a sudden and potentially messy divorce. He's also the person who's doing work on our building. He's over here working on our electric just to keep busy in days his other projects are being rained out. </p>

<p>--Another set of friends had some unexpected health problems. Another friends' brother has heart problems</p>

<p>--I got misquoted in the newspaper's coverage of our last historic district board of review meeting (though not really the reporter's fault). Between being misquoted and coverage of what other members said during the meeting, I suddenly feel like I have a target on my back in town. There's an "open forum" website in town, which has the high goal of free speech. That's fine, but it also enables people to slam you anonymously. Of course, I got slammed good. Unfortunately, I don't have a thick enough skin yet. I guess that's politics for you. I'm probably going to have to write a letter to the editor.</p>

<p>--There's other stuff going on, but publishing it here could put even a bigger target on my back. </p>

<p>As such, it's hard to concentrate. Going to class tomorrow will actually be a nice break.</p>

		<h2>01.22.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Friday at grad school #2</h3>
	
	<p>Boy yesterday was a long day. I walked out the door at 6:30 a.m. and walked back in at 7:30 p.m. I didn't do much of anything other than attend classes and drive. Let me tell you, my back didn't like that one bit. I then slept 11-1/2 hours.</p>

<p>I'm about as good as new this morning. While, I've been goofing off reading computer stuff this morning, I need to get reading for class. I need to review the book cataloging rules under the AACR2 (Anglo-American Cataloging Rules) for the next class and read a bunch of journal articles for Collection Development.</p>

<p>My new "toys" helped make yesterday seem shorter. As much as I hate the cell phone, being able to talk to Darlene between classes helped immensly. I listened to my iPod during the drive. Music on the way up (Michelle Shock's "Arkansas Traveler" is a great album) and an audio book on the way home (a collection of Poirot short stories). </p>

<p>The classes themselves went well. The morning class is a quiet one. Maybe everyone's not awake yet. Cataloging is like learning a computer language. There's a lot of picky stuff like making sure you have the proper punctuation in the proper spots. It makes me think of CSS. If you have a semi-colon out of place the whole webpage can break down. </p>

<p>[Darlene just saw a webpoll on CNN.com that asked whether Bush will achieve his second-term goals. It was a simple yes and no question. Darlene says the poll needs a third option. "How about 'over my dead body'?"]</p>

<p>The collection development class should be a challenge. The professor likes that the SLIS grading system where to get an A you have to do things so creative and beyond expectations that even the professor is surprised. Thus a 4.0 in her class will be very difficult, but hey I'm a creative sort.</p>

<p>The class itself is pretty large, 28 students, and at least a third of them are also working in public libraries and studying to become librarians. We already had some good conversations/debate yesterday. It should be fun.</p>

		<h2>01.19.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Have I forgotten how to read?</h3>
	
	<p>I'm slogging through "Wynar's Introduction to Cataloging and Classification" for my Friday morning class and it's slow going. </p>

<p>It's not that it's really hard to understand. Indeed, it all makes sense. For some reason I'm just having a hard time getting through it. </p>

<p>Part of it is learning to focus and strain out the outside world. For example, reading about library technology makes me think about work and everything I have to do there. </p>

<p>I think the rest of it is simply trying to read a completely different writing style. I'm used to a journalistic writing style. I read a lot of newspapers and magazines to keep up with current events. I read scientific articles regularly, but even so they are written in a very clear fashion. Everything I'm read feels as if it needs a good editing for clarity. I'm sure I'll get used to it, until then it is certainly making me feel dumb.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I'm keeping my eye on the weather. I fear I'll get to Indy and then a blizzard will move in while I'm in class. Hmmm... I wonder if they'll let me sleep on the tables in the library group study rooms.</p>

		<h2>01.17.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Good (slow) start to grad school</h3>
	
	<p>I am now officially a graduate student. I have my student ID. I attended my first class. I have my books. I took advantage of my student discount to buy some computer software (Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac $10, etc.). For the past couple of hours I've been sifting through the syllubus. Tomorrow I have a day off and will do a chunk of reading.</p>

<p><b>First impressions</b>: IUPUI is kind of a barren campus in the middle of winter. Great spanses of lawn with nothing to block the bitter wind. Other things are kind of disappointing. There's no university union for the students really and the bookstore is pretty sad. The univeristy is building a campus center for completion in 2007, but with all luck I'll be gone by then.</p>

<p>The university library, which will basically be my Friday home for the next two years, is a different story. The people are friendly and the structure has plenty of windows to let the sun shine in. [<a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedgehttps://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/images/univlibrary_1.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.ontheriversedge.comhttps://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/images/univlibrary_1.html','popup','width=138,height=281,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">View image</a>]</p>

<p>They have comfortable sitting areas behind the huge signature windows. However, the orientation doesn't lend itself to the nicest of views. The sciences building the library faces is probably only 20-years-old, but for some reason the structure is looking tired. </p>

<p>On the other hand, sitting in the study carrels, the whole southeast wall is glass and the huge windows overlook downtown Indianapolis. You can see the RCADome, the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art, the Indiana State Museum, the State House, Military Park and the skyscrapers around Monument Circle.  Nice view. I could probably site there and soak in the sun... oh yes, and study.</p>

<p>The folks in my cataloging class seem pretty cool. We have a slew of<br />
people from all walks of life-- everyone from teachers who realized they didn't want to teach to a post-doctoral information science professor wanting to expand her horizons in order to get today's "in" jobs. Only one other person working in a public library. </p>

<p>Cataloging is one of those keystone jobs. I never realized how important they were, but I'm quickly learning, the whole shooting match would be in<br />
disarray without them. I'll have to send Joy and Julie (our current and past catalogers) an extra piece of chocolate for Valentines Day.</p>

<p>My afternoon class, collection development, was cancelled as the prof was at a conference. Actually that helped because it allowed me to buy books and run errands. For example, my VPN account wasn't turned on and my webmail isn't working. I can send and receive, but I can't get replies. When I send a message, it doesn't include a "from" address. They have not yet figured that one out.</p>

<p>Darlene came up with me for the first day. She kept me company and helped celebrate my first day. After taking care of the odds and ends we wandered campus and Indy walking and driving around. </p>

<p><b>iPod craze</b>: We stopped at a Border's Books where Darlene bought a new Star Trek and a <a href="http://muttscomics.com/index.asp">Mutts</a> book. We then went to the Apple Store where everyone was drooling over the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/">iPod Shuffle</a>. They haven't been able to keep them in stock. They got a few hundred of the chewing gum stick shaped players that morning and sold them out in three hours. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, I bought the iPod I've been saving up for. I obviously wanted to listen to music (Wednesday nights in the children's room can get very quiet). But it is a handier tool than I imagined. For starters, the University Library has tons of computers so if I don't feel like lugging my laptop along, I can carry all my files along on my iPod and jack it into the firewire port. Secondly, it has all my contacts, calendars and notes. </p>

<p>Here's what I didn't expect-- I am able to put hyperlinked archives on the puppy. I downloaded a freeware program called <a href="http://www.flyingmeat.com/voodoopadlite.html">VoodooPad Lite</a>. You type a note and highlight any word. Turn that word into a link and you go to a new page where you write anything about that word. It's not unlike a Wiki website. All fine and dandy, but then it all uploaded onto the iPod-- still hyperlinked. I go to the index page and I can click around it like a webpage. That was a revelation.</p>

<p>By the end of the day we were exhausted. We rented a room and fell asleep. We woke up 12 hours later.</p>

<p><b>Georgia O'Keeffe exhibit</b>: After wandering around some more, we finally ended up at the <a href="http://www.eiteljorg.org/ejm/exhibitions.asp?ID=27">Eiteljorg Museum</a> which had just opened a new <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5707736/site/newsweek/">Georgia O'Keeffe exhibit</a>. It was simply beautiful. It'll be open for a couple of months. I plan to return. Another interesting part of the exhibit was quotes from O'Keeffe. I was also amazed how well spoken-well written she was. Unfortunately, no one there at the time knew where the quotes came from. I need to write the curator and find the source. If it was journals, I suspect they would be very good reading.</p>

<p>There were several wonderful pieces, but I'd say my favorites so far were two works she did while on assignment in Hawaii. The Dole company had commissioned her to do some work of pineapples so they could use the work for advertising. She never managed to paint a pineapple, but the two works she did paint are great. Dole later sent a pineapple plant to her home, but the painting was a disappointment.</p>

<p>That's week one down.</p>

	<h3>Action time to save Social Security</h3>
	
	<p>OK folks, it's time to act. I believe we need to preserve Social Security. It is inherently sound and can be rejuvenated with a few sensible adjustments.</p>

<p>The "death" of Social Security is just another lie from the Bush administration not unlike the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq (please note: <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/01/13/news/arms.html">they quit looking for them</a>).</p>

<p>Here's what you can do. Send your congressman and Senators an email or letter. Heck, even if you are in favor of this scheme, write a letter, it's a good exercise in flexing your power as a citizen and I highly encourage it.</p>

<p>I did it through MoveOn.org (<a href="http://www.moveon.org/socialsecurity/">here</a>), however you can also easily look up your Senators' (<a href="http://www.senate.gov/">here</a>) or Rep's (<a href="http://www.house.gov/">here</a>) email addresses.</p>

<p>Go to the extended version to see some basic background information on the topic from MoveOn.org. Also, I copied what I wrote.</p>

<p>I'll tell you what. <b>I have 10 Google email accounts I can give away.</b> The first 10 people who carbon copy me what they wrote to their reps (for or against) will get the still non-public Google email accounts. The kicker is I want them signed (name, city and email) and I will publish them here online. I won't publish the email addresses (that's how you get the accounts).</p>
	
	<p>Here's some quick info from MoveOn.org that I found after I wrote my letter.</p>

<blockquote>
George Bush and Republican leaders have made phasing out Social Security through privatization and massive benefit cuts their top priority for 2005. Members of Congress are choosing sides over the next couple of weeks.

<p>We need to make sure they choose correctly now�before a massive election-style campaign by George Bush and the Wall Street interests gets to them including what might be a $100 million TV ad campaign.</p>

<p>Social Security is a complicated issue, but the basics are really pretty simple:</p>

<p>� Social Security provides monthly benefits to some 44 million Americans who are retired, disabled or the survivor of a deceased parent. It provides most of the income for older Americans--some 64 percent of their support. It has lifted generations of seniors out of poverty.</p>

<p>� Social Security is not in crisis. That is an outright lie perpetrated in order to create the urgency for radical changes. Under conservative forecasts, the long-term challenges in Social Security do not manifest themselves until 2042. Even then Social Security has 70 percent of needed funds. That shortfall is smaller than the amount needed in 1983, the last time we overhauled Social Security. George Bush's Social Security crisis-talk is an effort to create a specter of doom -- just like the weapons of mass destruction claim in Iraq.</p>

<p>� Phasing out Social Security and replacing it with privatized accounts means one thing: massive cuts in monthly benefits for everybody. Social Security privatization requires diverting taxes used to pay current benefits into privatized accounts invested in risky stocks. Without that money Social Security benefits will inevitably be cut -- some proposals even cut benefits of current retirees. These benefit cuts are inevitable, since diverting Social Security money into privatized accounts means less money to pay current and future benefits.</p>

<p>� Every serious privatization proposal raises the Social Security retirement age to 70. That might be fine if you're a Washington special interest lobbyist but it is incredibly unfair to blue-collar Americans with tough, physical jobs, or for African Americans and Latinos with lower life expectancies.</p>

<p>� Privatization means gambling with your retirement security. There is probably an appropriate place for a little stock market risk in retirement planning -- but it isn't Social Security. Privatization exposes your entire retirement portfolio to stock market risks -- and the risk that you'll outlive any of your savings at retirement. You can't outlive your Social Security benefit.</p>

<p>� So who does benefit? Wall Street. Giant financial services firms have been salivating for decades over the prospect of taking over Social Security. Wall Street would make billions of dollars in profit by managing the privatized accounts -- money that would come directly from your benefits.</p>

<p>� Action is urgently needed today. President Bush and Republican leaders in Congress are joining forces with the financial services industry for a major campaign to convince the public there is a major crisis and pressure members of Congress to vote for privatization. Action is needed now before it is too late. Please sign MoveOn�s petition to protect Social Security at the link below.</p>

<p>http://www.moveon.org/socialsecurity/</p>

<p>Thanks for doing this.</blockquote></p>

<p><br />
Finally, here is what I wrote on the issue...</p>

<blockquote>Dear Sirs,

<p>Please do not scrap Social Security in exchange for private of individual accounts. I am a 38-year-old going to grad school to become a librarian-- I have 401ks, thus I am not among those inherently scared of the stock market.</p>

<p>However, I have several reasons to believe this action should not take place.</p>

<p>1--Privatization may allow for greater growth of deposited funds. However, the stock market is not "secure." The point of Social Security is to help seniors avoid poverty and the welfare rolls. The point is specifically to insure a snippet of "security" for their retirement. Prior to the induction of Social Security, elderly poverty was indeed very high.</p>

<p>2--In my profession, there is a generation of older librarians who were planning on retiring in the past five years. The market bubble burst and they are still out of luck. I know of people (librarians and others) who are having to wait years before they will again be in the position to retire. I personally know of a couple others who needed to retire for health reasons, but because their 401k tanked they had to continue working parttime in order to afford medicines, etc.</p>

<p>3--Finally, history has shown these schemes have been disasterous or near disasterous in other countries. Argentina and United Kingdom come to mind. The UK under Thatcher passed measures very similar to those being mentioned as possible under this plan. The Brits are now publically saying the plan was a failure and that they are now wishing they had a system like our current Social Security. When Argentina went belly up, it was in part due to a similar privatization scheme driving them deep into debt.</p>

<p>4--I do not like being white washed with proganda from our government. Recent memos from the White House have made it clear they are purposefully distorting the issue as a means of undermining the nation's trust in the institution. So explain this, how can the White House say the system is doomed when the Congressional Budget Office research shows Social Security is inherently sound and can be extended decades with no reduction in benefits with sensible adjustments. </p>

<p>--Finally, we are supposedly doing this for our youngest generations-- for myself (I'm among the oldest Gen Xers) and those who follow me. Yet, the federal decifit and debt already out of hand. To pull this off, the nation would have to borrow billions more. Who will pay for it? We will and our children will. This is nothing more than a baby tax. </p>

<p>Good sirs, we are only as good as the world we leave our children. I would rather pay a few more dollars today in taxes and spare the next umpteen generations having to pay for our mistakes.</p>

<p>sincerely,<br />

	<h3>Minis, Shuffles and Pages oh my!</h3>
	
	<p>Every year about this time, Mac Addicts around the world start dreaming and drooling over what Steve Jobs might announce during the MacWorld Conference Keynote.</p>

<p>Well this morning was the morning and I'm really rather impressed with the results. </p>

<p>Here are what I consider the highlights:</p>

<p>They finally have the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle">$99 iPod</a> everyone want. It's called the iPod Shuffle. It's the size of a pack of gum. An elegant white pack of gum. No screen to pick out the tunes, rather you program a playlist through iTunes and load it up. You can either have it loop the list or shuffle the list at random. You can even use it as a flash drive. 512mb for $99 or 1gb for $149.</p>

<p>An interesting new word processing-design program called <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/pages/">Pages</a>. Pages is a mid-range product. It won't take the place of Quark XPress or Microsoft Word, but it looks like it can do the basics rather well. Lots of control over style and type. It also has term paper basics like footnotes and tables of contents. Best of all, it incorporates basic page design such as call-out boxes, photos and columns. I'm hoping everyone who's the editor of a club newsletter gets their hands on a copy. Because it's loaded with some pretty decent templates, even the worst Pages document would look better than what most of the junk created on a PC using Microsoft Publisher.</p>

<p>But probably what everyone was waiting for was the announcement of an awesome low-end computer-- the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini">Mac Mini</a> for $499. </p>

<p>You need to add a monitor, keyboard and mouse, but it'll take any standard accessory so you could get easily buy a decent setup for under $700. I'm noticing rebates for free keyboards and mouse at the online warehouses.</p>

<p>Apparently with an adapter you can even plug the Mac Mini into a television or stereo and it can be turned into an entertainment center for playing movie, looking at photo slideshows or listening to music.</p>

<p>Adding wirless and things like that will run up the cost a bit, but still it's a good deal.</p>

<p>The kicker? This puppy is small-- the size of a stack of CD cases 2 inches thick!</p>

<p>There's a lot, lot more! Those were just my three favs. For more details check out <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple's</a> website for details or <a href="http://www.macsurfer.com">MacSurfer</a> for a collection of headlines and commentary.</p>

	<h3>The Ohio is out and about</h3>
	
	<p><img alt="Ohioflooded.jpg" src="http://www.ontheriversedge.comhttps://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/images/Ohioflooded.jpg" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></p>

<p>The river is now definitely out of its banks, fortunately we're only looking at minor flooding here. While it's covered our riverfront road and parklands, I'm hoping it stays out of the few houses that are down on the river front. They suffered enough in 1997.</p>

<p>I posted a <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/egyarnetsky/PhotoAlbum5.html">new album of photos</a> Darlene and I took yesterday and today. When you check out the photos, take a look at the riverfront light posts. When the flood waters of 1997 crested, only the globe on top was above the water.</p>

<p>For those who know Madison, the photo above is taken at dusk looking west from the <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?country=US&addtohistory=&formtype=address&searchtype=address&cat=&address=Elm%20St%20%26%20W%20Vaughn%20Dr&city=Madison&state=IN&zipcode=47250&searchtab=home">foot of Elm Street</a> (three blocks south of our library). The walled area is the lower lawn of the Lanier Mansion.</p>

<p>The river's expected to crest tomorrow late morning. We'll be out taking more photos. It's odd to be gawkers. I guess it's the old journalistic instincts to go out and cover the story.</p>

<p>For "real" daily coverage, however, check the <a href="www.madisoncourier.com">The Madison Courier</a>.</p>

	<h3>Tsunami video</h3>
	
	<p>Maybe everyone has seen video footage of the Indian Ocean Tsunami already. Not watching television, I have not. Today Darlene and I discovered several links to see footage. The videos are all in the 10-15 mb range.</p>

<p>Here's footage stored at <a href="http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=tsunami">Archive.org</a> and <a href="http://www.waveofdestruction.org/videos/">Wave of Destruction</a>.</p>

<p>Two videos seem to really deliver it home. </p>

<p>The first is from <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=index2&cid=968">AP video via Yahoo News</a> of the water rushing through the streets of an Indonesian city. Whole minivans being pushed down the street. (catch this link quickly, it may not last).</p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.archive.org/movies/details-db.php?collection=opensource_movies&collectionid=tsunami_phuket">amateur video</a> is in Phuket where the tsunami is coming in for a second wave. </p>

<p>The man holding the video camera follows it as it washes over the resort area and literally into the restaurant he is standing in. You river of water rushing by through the restaurant, his words saying it all. "Shit... shit... shit..." I admit I wouldn't be able to think of much more to say either. </p>

<p>Keep an eye on the corner of the screen where two men hold on for dear life to a fence, but are washed away. Unfortunately, the camera moves and we don't see what happens.</p>

	<h3>Waters are a coming?</h3>
	
	<p>Well, I guess the Midwest can't get a snow storm and then days of rain without the Ohio River sending it all back our way.</p>

<p>The National Weather Service's <a href="http://www.crh.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ahps.cgi?LMK&clfi3">Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service</a> is saying the Ohio River will likely top flood stage here in Madison Sunday morning. Here's the graph...</p>

<p><img alt="clfi3.gif" src="http://www.ontheriversedge.comhttps://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/images/clfi3.gif" width="450" height="350" border="0" /></p>

<p>I covered the last flood in 1997 extensively for <a href="http://www.madisoncourier.com">The Madison Courier</a>. I'm hoping there won't be a repeat. Houses along Vaughn Drive (our river road) were flooded halfway up the first floor. The river hit 460.90 feet, the eighth worst recorded flood at Madison.</p>

<p>It was amazingly scary to look inside the homes after being visited by the Ohio River. A half foot of river silt covered every surface from the floor to the sinks. The walls were laid bare half-way to the ceiling, the drywall disintegrated. We are so used to seeing the barriers, suddenly seeing straight through a house with only beams in the way is like looking at a ghost.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: The river crests are measured from sea level, not the bottom of the river. For comparison, the river bottom at Madison is at 403.2 or 402.3 (I can never remember which). It's normal depth at this time of year would probably be about 420. I added the river stage under Madison links. </p>

	<h3>On blogging and blog reading</h3>
	
	<p>After "retiring" from journalism, I started this blog in 2003 as a way to get myself writing again. It's an easy way for friends and family to keep up with us and over the past year, for better or worse, it has also evolved into a personal soap box. </p>

<p>About once every six weeks I check the site statistics and every time the numbers have astounded me. I guess everyone who blogs wants to be read, but why have readers visited my blog <i>thousands</i> of times in 2004? </p>

<p>I visit blogs because they have something worthwhile to read. I like it when a writer manages to think outside the box and write something beyond the "echo chamber." When you read news, blogs and commentary on a regular basis, coming up with something unique is truly a challenge. Thus when it happens it's definitely worth reading. While my writing isn't horrible, I can't imagine more than a 10 of my 300 entries reaching that pinacle. </p>

<p>I suspect if I specialized on writing one topic, it would be easier to create good content. On the flip side, specialization takes a greater level of research, you cannot blog off the cuff as I always do. Nothing will kill a good entry faster than the lack of time or lack of motivation. I've lost count of the issues I have not written about due to the lack of one or the other.</p>

<p>Either way, with my writing and the possible interest people might have in it causes me to expect maybe 20 visits a day. Yet, I'm now averaging 250 a day. I realize a chunk are from search engines and another large chunk are from robots looking to deposit comment spam, but still why are the numbers growing? <br />
Are these numbers high for an off the cuff blog or is this pretty average or even low?</p>

<blockquote>Jan: 815 - Feb: 2,070 - March: 2,401 - April: 2,207 - May: 3,651 - June: 3,372 - July: 4,762 - Aug: 4,305 - Sept: 4,716 - Oct: 6,463 - Nov: 7,080 - Dec: 10,591.</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, nothing will change here much as I'll be starting grad school in a week. I'm excited and ready to go.</p>

	<h3>Joy of Tech</h3>
	
	<p>I recently added comics as a new category to my brown links bar. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.overduemedia.com/archive.aspx">Unshelved</a> is awesome if you love or work in libraries. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.geekculture.com/joyoftech/index.html">Joy of Tech</a> is a pretty good one for anyone who follows the "cult of mac" or simply enjoys good tech humor. Whenever the icon changes, you have a new Mac/Tech cartoon to read.</p>

<p>I like today's cartoon. I wish I could get away with the excuse. Here's the <a href="http://www.geekculture.com/joyoftech/joyarchives/635b.html">direct link</a> if you miss it.</p>

<p>I'll add more links to my favorite comics eventually, so keep an eye on the list.</p>

	<h3>Ice glazed family</h3>
	
	<p><i>[<b>Note</b>: Darlene's family in the Lima, Ohio, area was hit with an ice storm. She got a call into her family. It's pretty bad up there, but I think I'd take this over a tsunami. The notion that 400,000 could be dead-- I can't comprehend. Either way, Darlene's report...]</i></p>

<p>Just heard from family up in Northwest Ohio.  We have been fussing here about the endless rain, but they got the ice storm last night.  At least 20,000 without power as of this morning.  Trees down, poles down, wires in the road.  Two counties up there have closed the roads completely.  Some of the branches my brother Stan saw had at least 2 inches of ice on them. My sister Sharon is out in the country.  Poles along her road for a mile or so are all down.  Was told it would be at least 3 days to restore power.  (Luckily my father has a generator and they were able to hook it up for her)  Sister Janie called me last night at about 10.  They moved last spring into the country outside of Bluffton, north of Lima, and trees surround their house.  They said their yard was full of big limbs and the crashing was continual.  Haven't heard from her today.</p>

<p>Both my brother Stan and my sister Rosalie said Lima looks like a war zone due to all the trees and poles down.  Stan drove across Lima last night and said up to 8 blocks in a row would be completely dark and that he kept having to detour around because so many city streets were blocked. Trees that are not down are losing limbs or bending wildly.  </p>

<p>Family friend who lives next to a woods says the crashing sounds kept him up all night.  When my brother went over this morning they could still hear endless crashing sounds in the woods.</p>

<p>So I guess I will take the rain, although the Ohio river is rising very fast!</p>

	<h3>Challenge the Ohio vote</h3>
	
	<p>I hope at least one senator has the courage to join with U.S. Rep. John Conyers and challenges the electoral vote in Ohio tomorrow. It would not overthrow the election but it <i>would</i> force Congress to debate what happened in Ohio. </p>

<p>For better or worse, I believe Bush received the votes to win Ohio. However the methods used to depress minority voting in Ohio were technically illegal at best and outright fraudulant at worst. I strongly believe these violations need to be debated at the highest levels with true reforms put into place.</p>

<p>There are plenty of oddities in the Ohio vote -- as well as plenty of unsubstantiated conspiracy theories. However, I believe this much is clear-- there is absolutely no excuse for rich, white, suburban precincts to get a boat load of voting machines while poor, minority, urban districts are given few machines, especially when machines were kept back in storage to boot. Vote suppression is the only reason-- the Republican hope that minorities would get sick of waiting in line and go home without casting their vote.</p>

<p>Honestly, what is the difference between forcing African-Americans and other minorities to use under-staffed, under-mechanized voting precincts and forcing blacks to use separate entrances at a movie theaters or sitting in the back of a bus or "separate but (not) equal" schools? In my book, none whatsoever.</p>

	<h3>Snippets for Jan. 5, 2005</h3>
	
	<p>We partied like crazy over the New Year's holiday. My mom visited from Buffalo for a few days. We visited with friends, ate midnight dinner to end out 2004 and visited more friends on New Years Day. We've played with kids and played games like crazy folk.</p>

<p><br />
We had warm temperatures all last week that quickly melted our snow and it has rained ever since. We're expecting a "bankful" in the Ohio River here at Madison. Creeks in the region are flooding. While we're getting a ton of rain, Darlene's sister in Blufton, Ohio, is getting an ice storm. Branches breaking everywhere.</p>

	<h3>When a cartoonist dies</h3>
	
	<p>Whenever a cartoonist dies, the world loses a bit of humor, artistry and adventure. </p>

<p><b>Charles Schulz'</b> death a few years back was heart breaking. More than any other cartoonist, he had my admiration. He single handedly drew the same comic strip for nearly 50 years, never taking a vacation, never using a ghost artist. Even when he hands shook from illness, he kept at it. </p>

<p>While the quality of the writing admittedly dropped in the later years, Peanuts is easily the best cartoon ever drawn. The work in the 60s, 70s and early 80s was heartfelt, thoughtful and even whimsical. There are other stars, but Schulz was the best.</p>

<p><b>Will Eisner,</b> however, was in his league and his death on Monday is a huge loss to the cartooning world.</p>

<p>Eisner is not a household name, but he is considered the "<a href="http://www.dccomics.com/news/article_display.html?nw_dc_itemCode=willeisner2005">father of graphic novels</a>."</p>

<p>My favorite work is "The Spirit." Eisner created mini-comics books every week which were inserted into Sunday newspapers for years in the 1940s. The protagonist Denny Colt was a detective who was "killed on duty." Actually he was in suspended animation and woke up buried in the Wildwood Cemetery. He decided to use his "death" to gain anonymity in order to continue hunting the bad guys as "The Spirit."</p>

<p>The storylines were everything from suspenseful to slyly humorous. The artwork, even considering it was printed on cheap newsprint, was awesome. The art started out simple, but as the series continued Eisner experimented with both style and content. Reading his work today you can easily see that nearly ever comic book and graphic novel artist has stolen some element from "the Spirit." </p>

<p>Here are a couple links<br />
<a href="http://www.willeisner.com">Will Eisner.com</a><br />
<a href="http://http://www.angelfire.com/art/wildwood/">Wildwood Cemetery: The Spirit Database</a><br />
<a href="http://www.willeisner.com">DC Comics: The Spirit Archives</a>. I highly recommend reading any of these volumes. <br />
<a href="http://www.dccomics.com/features/we_spirit/ecomic.html">A sample Spirit</a> e-comic reprint from 1946.</p>

<p>One side note: As much as I love the Spirit, one thing bothers me about the series. I find the Spirit's "black sidekick" Ebony White disturbing. I once attended a seminar detailing how African-Americans have been portrayed in pop culture over the past 150 years. The history is distrubing at best and absolutely disgusting at worst. Until then I had not realized the meanness, and indeed sheer evil intent, that a drawing can convey. Thus I find Ebony White, as "normal" as he may have seemed in the 1940s, disturbing.</p>

<h4>what.</h4>
<ul><li>This is a journal of our life, culture, libraries, the Apple Macintosh, progressive politics, and of course historic Madison, Indiana, the most beautiful rivertown in America.</li></ul>

<h4>who.</h4> 

<ul><li>G'day, I'm E.G. Yarnetsky and I answer questions at our local library. I'm preparing to go to grad school in January. I'm a former journalist who still dabbles in design work. My wife's a potter who makes beautiful functional and sculptural ceramics.</li></ul>
