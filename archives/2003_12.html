	<h3>New Years Eve possum</h3>
	
	<p>New York drops the ball, but Brasstown drops a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/31/national/31POSS.html?8hpib">Possum.</a> From the NY Times:</p>

<blockquote>At midnight, as he lets a rope slip between his fingers, lowering a possum in a plexiglass cage from the roof of his gas station, Mr. Logan will call out, as he has every New Year's Eve since 1990, "5, 4, 3, 2, 1!"

<p> And then, as the crowd starts going bananas, "The possum has landed!"  The possum is alive, of course, and will be released at the end of the night unharmed, if a little shaken.</blockquote><br />
Meanwhile I plan to drop kick 2003 into history!</p>

	<p>My father-in-law went beyond the call of duty and spent at least 10 hours working on our cargo van (a.k.a. "The Beast" because it drives like one). </p>

<p>Our van didn't have heat as the motor died so he rigged up a 20-year-old RV heater that gave us a toasty ride all the way home. While he was at it, he discovered the floor board at our feet were rusted through. No wonder my feet were freezing. There so little metal down there. So he screwed metal down. To top it off he also put in a new motor in our existing heater so our defroster would work. </p>

<p>We spent $27 for parts the rest were odd and end spares he had hiding away in his three barns.</p>

<p>Boy do we owe him. That was an amazing gift.</p>

	<p>During my recent readings of the news I have found myself to be more and more in the minority of opinion in America.</p>

<p>I'm apparently in the minority of folks who are in opposition to President Bush and his war against Iraq.</p>

<p>I'm in the minority of college educated white males who are Democrats let alone progressive.</p>

<p>I'm in the minority of people who use Macintosh computers.</p>

<p>But then there's the little things. I'm in the minority who want to preserve our civil rights. I just read an article that only 6 percent of Americans understand the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. No wonder noone is questioning the Patroit Act.</p>

<p>What makes it frustrating is I'm in one of the "red" states that is a "shoe-in" for Bush and to top it off we have a May primary date so I can't even get in my two-cents about who Bush's opponent should be. Thus my vote hardly counts for president. Voting for congress is as close as I can get.</p>

<p>Then of course there's the problem of Microsoft recommending "critical" updates for our library computers which in turn crashes the system.</p>

<p>No politics and computers don't really match up, but they both frustrate me nonetheless. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the only Democratic candidate who uses Macs is Al Sharpton. Is he a fascinating man because he uses a fascinating computer or do fascinating men use fascinating computers?</p>

	<p>For my friend and family with a sweettooth here's a great article from Wired Magazine about the elusive search for the perfect sugar substitute.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.11/newsugar.html">Hitting the Sweet Spot:</a> <br />
<blockquote>"Now comes a sweetener that does all the wannabes one better: It's natural. It actually is sugar. Unlike high-intensity artificial sweeteners, tagatose looks, tastes, and cooks like sugar. It's 92 percent as sweet as table sugar but with only 38 percent of the calories. Studies suggest it prevents weight gain and doesn't cause cavities. It's safe for diabetics and may even help combat the disease."</blockquote></p>

	<p>I actually did something constructive last night. I started filling in the million nail holes and cracks left on the plaster walls over the past 150 years. It was actually kind of fun as scary as I find that.<br />
 <br />
My friend Pat the tinman is a strict preservationist and he'd kill me for scraping off the old wallpaper that's underneath. He'd prefer I uncovered as much as I could so he could reproduce it and put it back up. His friend is a printmaker and they could pull it off. Mind you he's been working on doing that with his house for a few years now, but is still working to redo the plaster.<br />
 <br />
Well, I'm only doing a quarter of the room to start. We'll experiment with paint colors on that before doing the whole room. Thus there will still be 3/4 of the room for him to play with. <br />
 <br />
I did manage to peel the paint off one of the wallpapers. It is a flower motif made out of red and white dots- a tacky impressionistic feel. Below that is a blue and gold wallpaper, though I haven't uncovered enough of that to figure out what it looks like.</p>

<p>No, the wallpaper isn't worth preserving. Pat believes they knew how do design back in the Victorian days. You just had to see everything and not judge it from one piece of wallpaper.</p>

<p>Some of it I don't mind. I could easily live in the house from "My Fair Lady" and I love old places, but I'll stick with my own interior colors thank you very much.<br />
 <br />
We're thinking of an a dark avacado with some sort of off white trim and ceiling for our living/bedroom. Our kitchen will be a warm golden yellow with the same trim. Maybe our hall will be a nice golden orange (or some such).<br />
 <br />
It'd be easier to get excited about doing the work if we didn't have leaking chimneys. We'll have to live with it for another few months. At least he's around working on our bathroom right now. Getting the plumbing figured out will be a huge jump (water in our kitchen, no taking baths in Darlene's glaze room).</p>

		<h2>12.15.03</h2>

	<p>Here's a fascinating read from The Washington Post that answers the question<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A58554-2003Dec12?language=printer">"What will happen when a national political machine can fit on a laptop?"</a></p>

<blockquote>" ....For all Dean's talk about wanting to represent the truly "Democratic wing of the Democratic Party," the paradox is that he is essentially a third-party candidate using modern technology to achieve a takeover of the Democratic Party. Other candidates -- John Kerry, John Edwards, Wesley Clark -- are competing to take control of the party's fundraising, organizational and media operations. But Dean is not interested in taking control of those depreciating assets. He is creating his own party, his own lists, his own money, his own organization. What he wants are the Democratic brand name and legacy, the party's last remaining assets of value, as part of his marketing strategy."</blockquote>

<p>Everett Ehrlich, a former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs under President Bill Clinton, takes a mid-20th century economic theory about how "the cost of information dictates the size of the organization" and explains how it will greatly impact the future of politics in America.</p>

	<p>To avoid nightmares -- DON'T DRIVE IN THE FIRST SNOW OF THE SEASON!</p>

<p>Darlene and I went to Columbus, Indiana, last night which is about an hour's drive from here to drop off some pots at a gallery and to pickup the brochure I designed from the printers.</p>

<p>It wasn't too bad on the way up, people were driving slow, but that's to be expected. On the way home, however, that one hour drive became a 2-1/2 hour drive. </p>

<p>I knew the roads were starting to get a bit slick because you'd feel a little slipping on starting and stopping. I saw a salt truck behind me so I pulled off in order to drive on the salt. I turned off and started to turn around when sliiiide-bang. I kissed a cement retaining wall in front of a church. Fortunately I was only going 3-5mph. I bent the bumper, but I lucked out in that it didn't puncture the tire (an inch away). I was able to pull the bumper out enough to keep going with no problems.</p>

<p>For the next 90 minutes everyone was driving 15-20 mph on a state highway. People were spun out on the sides of the road. An instant later two cars ahead of me a guy going north spins out into our lane and ends up going south. I saw it and slowed down in time, but I'm amazed the guy in front of me didn't get plastered.</p>

<p>Once traffic let up, things were better and I was going a nice slow and consistant 35. The roads got a little better as we went south.</p>

<p>Then I made the mistake of assuming the state highway garage had plowed one of our steep hills going into downtown Madison. It was SLICK. A woman had spun out big time, blocking the road and I was the first to come up behind her. She was screaming that she didn't know how to get out of the slide area. Meanwhile, our van was slipping all over the place and I narrowly avoided slidding into another car next to me.</p>

<p>We finally got down the hill in low gear and I thought we were home free when a guy came flying up the street making an opposite left at the same time I was. Out of the corner of my eye I saw him spin out and barely managed to move out of getting hit in the rear end.</p>

<p>That would have been one thing, but then instead of letting me have my right-of-way, he peeled out going the same way I was and turned fast down the next block. As it was now midnight I wonder if he was drunk.</p>

<p>Thus the nightmare and the lesson learned... don't drive in the season's first snow.</p>

	<p>Bob Herbert of The New York Times in his column <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/12/opinion/12HERB.html">No Will to Win?</a> seems to nicely wrap up the panic and division in the Democratic Party right now.</p>

<p>It amazes me how the Democratic "establishment" is freaking over Gore's endorsement of Dean. For better or worse I'd have to agree with Gore that Dean's the only man with a plan to win. </p>

<p>I'd like to see how his campaign develops over the next couple of months. How he moves from dark horse mode to thoroughbred mode will be telling.</p>

<p>Can he move to the center before Bush tars him as a left winger? Mind you how can a fiscal conservative, pro-states rights person be labeled as a left-winger?</p>

<p>He's been quoted as saying "Let's not elect a president based on God, gays and guns" I think the rest of the sentence was something to the effect of "but rather good jobs, good education for our children and health care for all."  The problem is I've rarely seen the second in the press. </p>

<p>The Republicans will focus on the "G's" to avoid talking about the rest of it, but they have hit on issues people care about. How will Dean address those issues? Here's a <a href="http://www.deanforamerica.com/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=10881&JServSessionIdr004=bi5oco74x1.app193a&security=1&news_iv_ctrl=1321">speech he gave in South Carolina recently</a> that hints at an answer.</p>

<p>But it's too early to answer these questions, thus let's wait a couple of months before anointing someone. Whomever does win needs to have, as Herbert states, a huge will to win.</p>

	<p>Our library's applying for a grant that will give the library $1,850 worth of books, videos, CD-ROM and brochures about urban trees. April of next year will be tree month at the library and we'll host programs and help out with the city's Arbor Day celebration.</p>

<p>Darlene and I go to the celebration each year. It's a lot of fun with Smoky Bear and maple cake and elementary school students doing treeish things. </p>

<p>Last year, the local landscaping-tree care company did demonstrations of trimming dead limbs and felled a dead tree. The kids were wide eyed as the dead limbs came down with splattering and slintering thunks. Watching them do their work suspended 30-40 feet up was impressive.</p>

<p>Mind you, later a few tree theorists debated whether it was a good thing to cut down dead trees and limbs in a park setting as they are usually inhabited by wildlife of all sorts.</p>

<p>At our grant planning meeting today, the city arborist/naturalist, a dear friend of ours, said there won't be any "felling" of trees this year. Another said in a mock gasp-- "oh, the f-word."</p>

<p>Another person got on her amazing soap box about how people go to museums to ooh and ahh over twisted sculpture when they can go into nature and see Gods very same work in dead trees.</p>

	<p>**I wrote to Clarion University and they're not sure when the next cohort is starting. The professor I wrote to was supposed to ask her chair whether a new class would start in 2005. It'd be perfect if it'd work. I'll just wait and see.</p>

<p>**We have book and video drops at our front door where anyone can make a quick drop off. A teenager dropped off his book and while the drawer was open screamed "YEAH!" into the box. The lid to the box was open so it acted like a megaphone and everyone in the library instantly craned their heads to figure out what in the world was going on.</p>

	<p>Between two botched wars, pork barrel giveaways that'd make the Democrats blush, and regressive labor and environmental policies, the Bush administration and Congress is getting me growly. </p>

<p>That alone would be one thing, but then they get hypocritical and moan about little things.</p>

<p>Take this past weekend for example. </p>

<p>Sen. John Kerry finally did something in his campaign that wasn't stilted. For months, he's been stymied by the question of why he voted for the Iraq War. In a Rolling Stone interview, he finally gave an answer that made sense and didn't hem and haw.</p>

<p>Mind you, it may be too late for him. Former Vt. Gov. Howard Dean is running a campaign unlike any witnessed before and he appears to be on a roll. He's 30 points up in the latest New Hampshire polls.</p>

<p>Here's what happened (according to an AP article):</p>

<blockquote>
WASHINGTON (AP--Dec.  7) - In an interview in the latest Rolling Stone magazine, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry used profane language to assess President Bush's Iraq policy, and Bush's chief of staff said Sunday the Democratic presidential candidate was out of line.

<p>When asked in the interview about the success of rival candidate Howard Dean, whose anti-war message has resounded with supporters, Kerry responded: "When I voted for the war, I voted for what I thought was best for the country. Did I expect Howard Dean to go off to the left and say, 'I'm against everything?' Sure. Did I expect George Bush to f*** it up as badly as he did? I don't think anybody did."</p>

<p>The expletive drew a rebuke from White House, which suggested an apology might be in order.</p>

<p>"That's beneath John Kerry," the president's chief of staff, Andrew Card, said on CNN.</p>

<p>"I'm very disappointed that he would use that kind of language," Card said. "I'm hoping that he's apologizing at least to himself, because that's not the John Kerry that I know."</p>

<p>The Kerry campaign said the Massachusetts senator had no regrets.</p>

<p>"John Kerry saw combat up close, and he doesn't mince words when it comes to politicians who put ideological recklessness ahead of American troops," said spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter. "I think the American people would rather Card and the rest of the White House staff spend more time on fixing Bush's flawed policy in Iraq than on Senator Kerry's language."<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>The whole thing is funny really because Bush has used the very same language. I did a search on the net on came up with these examples which were from newspaper articles and columns:</p>

<p>Bush told Condi Rice "F*** Saddam, we're taking him out." </p>

<p>In front of his own daughters Bush told Wall Street Journal Washington Bureau Chief Al Hunt: "You no good f***ng son of a bitch. I will never f***ing forget what you wrote."?</p>

<p>At a '99 fundraiser candidate Bush said his goal as President would be to "reverse all the f***ups of the Clinton administration and then f*** the Democrats over."? This was in front of the press.</p>

<p>Bush 5, Kerry 1. Draw your own conclusions.</p>

	<p>I'm still hoping to go to graduate school next year, but I came to the conclusion I wasn't looking forward to the four hour round trip drive to Indianapolis every week for two years. We just don't have a vehicle that'd handle that kind of driving (let alone a driver).</p>

<p>A couple of people had encouraged me to look at distance education. I had looked a couple of programs but they were all at least twice as expensive due to out of state tuition and required site visits (five days during the summer and a weekend each semester was typical).</p>

<p>Well I found a new one last night.  <a href="http://www.clarion.edu/edu-humn/newlibsci/index.htm">Clarion University of Pennsylvania</a> has just started a web-based program oriented toward rural librarianship (that's interesting in and of itself).</p>

<p>There doesn't appear to be site visits (save travel and housing costs), but if it does we have friends who live just an hour away.</p>

<p>Also the costs are only $1,500 more per year than Indianapolis and I'd save at least that much by not have to pay for gas and food every week. For some reason, they charge out-of-state distance learning only 102% of regular tuition (just don't take a class on campus or they'll smack your bursar's account one good).</p>

<p>The only downsides so far is each cohort (a group of students who will take the classes together over the two year period) is limited to 25 students. The very first cohort starts next month with the second starting in January 2005. If I can get in that might be just about perfect as far as timing goes.</p>

<p>I sent away for information, we'll see what it looks like.</p>

	<p>This morning I was complaining to a cohort that it was too quiet at the library. Not again.</p>

<p>This afternoon was an absolute madhouse. Some kids managed to surf the net with our online catalog machine that allegedly had security on it to prevent surfing. A keyboard died. An Internet novice wanted to search for Florida properties before their vacation. We had a "Wizard of Oz" marionette show and all the kids returned and got more books (including an entire 3rd grade class). A couple salesmen called. It was non-stop.</p>

<p>As Darlene would say "Now you wouldn't want to be bored now would you?"</p>

	<p>I've always been a fan of sports team nicknames. At one point a few years back (for some reason) I collected every team name I could find. Finding the stories behind the names would have been a fun task, but apparently Emerson Houk beat me to the punch with his book<a href="http://www.indystar.com/articles/9/098706-4639-047.html">"Go Huskies! Beat Felix the Cat!"</a></p>

<p>It should prove to be entertaining, the link is to an Indy Star article. Here's a snipet:</p>

<p>"Houck didn't realize just how peculiar and possibly telling a mascot could be until just a few years ago, when he and his wife were meandering toward St. Louis...</p>

<p>He loved being greeted by signs that announced he was entering, say, "Austin: Where Eagles Soar." He liked the display of pride.</p>

<p>He was struck particularly when, heading to St. Louis, he pulled into the Illinois town of Teutopolis, "Home of the Wooden Shoes." The same day he found himself in Effingham, "Home of the Flaming Hearts," and then to Vandalia, "Home of the Vandals," Roxanna, "Home of the Shells," and finally, Centralia, "Home of the Orphans."</p>

<p>"That's when I dug in," Houck says. He says that in 1922, Centralia had a basketball team that reached the state championship in Champaign, where a sportswriter wrote that the Centralians "played like champs but looked like orphans."</p>

<p>The school, which did not then have a mascot, embraced the snub.</p>

<p>Years later, when girls' teams came into being, those teams were not the "Lady Orphans," they were the "Annies."</p>

<p>Fun stuff</p>

	<p>It never fails ... when I think work is about to get boring-- snow starts to fall in hell followed by thunderstorms of cats and dogs (who then proceed to fall in love and form political parties). </p>

<p>This is not in a bad thing, mind you. Rather it reminds me what I like about working in a library-- you never know what you'll end up doing next.</p>

<p>It's just that I'm suddenly finding that I have more on my plate than I can keep track of. </p>

<p>I need some method of keeping track of my to-do list that I'll actually keep track of. Scraps of paper simply did not do the job. Notebooks are a little better, but not very flexible. Keeping notes on computer would work if I actually had a single computer. I'd be tempted to try using a PDA, but I don't know if I'd take the time to write in the entries every time something new pops up.</p>

<p>Hmm, I'm running out of options here. Suggestions taken, though simple orders of "get organized!" will be immediately be trashed.</p>

	<p>An interesting bill has just passed the Indiana Senate requiring library budgets to be approved by the county councils.</p>

<p>Currently, the library has its own taxing district and its own "appointed" board. This board approves the budget each year without input from elected officials.</p>

<p>A state senator was mad that the Allen County-Fort Wayne libraries passed a construction bond to rebuild the county's libraries without oversight from an elected body.</p>

<p>My director said one option being considered for a lobbying effort by the Indiana Library Federation is to transform library boards from appointed to elected boards.</p>

<p>The only downside I can see at the moment would be from an intellectual freedom standpoint. People with an axe to grind could easily become a board member and make life miserable for its director and staff. On the other hand, it could bring a higher profile to the library and give people more a vested interest.</p>

<p>There are a lot of details about the bill I'm unfamiliar with, but it could be interesting to see what happens.</p>

<p>Here's an <a href="http://www.indystar.com/articles/2/095784-8872-009.html">article</a> about the proposed bill.</p>

	<p>The library's break room table always has sweets on it. I'm still debating whether to give in to the awaiting pumpkin pie. UPDATE: I capitulated and ate a piece.</p>
