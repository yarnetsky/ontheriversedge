	<h3>Nice political analogy</h3>
	
	<p>There's a new online political magazine I'm enjoying called <a href="http://gadflyer.com">The Gadflyer</a>. The site started up on March 15th and calls for an aggressive progressive agenda. </p>

<p>They're a bit of a throwback to pre-1970s Democrats who didn't hesistate to throw punches as needed to accomplish their agenda. Yet, the issues and solutions are 21st century.</p>

<p>They started a feature today called "Reply All" for email interviews with newsmakers. First up is <a href="http://gadflyer.com/replyall/">Senator John Kerry</a>.</p>

<p>One reason I like Kerry for his "weakness" of giving nuanced answers. To me it shows me the guy actually thinks, that he looks at all sides of an issue and actually takes them into consideration.</p>

<p>Mind you, it's hard to get nuanced answer in an email, so the feature is mildly disappointing in that manner. However, I did like part of his final answer. </p>

<blockquote>
<b>John Kerry:</b> ...
I love the challenge involved in playing hockey. Wayne Gretzky was asked why he was such a good hockey player and he always said, "You know most guys go to where the puck is. I go to where the puck is going to be." For me, I think that's also a statement about life and politics. It's about which issues you choose to fight for and how much you're willing to look toward tomorrow's challenges today.</blockquote>

	<h3>Planety, planety night</h3>
	
	<p>OK, so it doesn't sound as good as stary, stary night, but starting tonight the planets will be the attraction as five planets will be visible in the same sky at one time.</p>

<p>Look around the moon at sunset and you'll find Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Mercury and Saturn (and of course the moon). <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2004/19mar_planets.htm">NASA</a> has the details on this evening sky event.  </p>

<p>Thanks to our friend "Ms. Tree" for passing along the word. We spent one early morning with her in the middle of nowhere lying on the side of a road watching a meteor shower. It was a really foggy night and we found one spot where the sky had a clearing. That was fun!</p>

		<h2>03.16.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>We've been busy</h3>
	
	<p>The last few days have been a flurry of construction at our building. We took down a partition wall to give Darlene more space in her studio. Actually, our friend Pat did the work, we were just gophers, haulers and 2 by 4 de-nailers.</p>

<p>We also replaced some drainlines in the basement. Our building was a restaurant at one time and the drainline was all but clogged with grease (it was entirely clogged, but again Pat roto-routed it out enough to get it flowing.</p>

<p>Lifting the PVC pipe was like lifting a pipe of iron. Very odd.</p>

<p>At one point during the weekend we peaked up into the attic (one thing that oddly enough we never did before). We discovered that we have two roofs. One was built six feet above the first. The first didn't have much slope, very Federal style. Amazing stuff, but it'll be a pain if we ever need to replace the vent lines.</p>

<p>The only other excitement is finally getting our tax figures to our accountant.</p>

<p>Like an old amusement park commercial (Fantasy Island in New York during the 1970s) stated -- "Fun? Wow!!!"</p>

	<h3>A lack of scientific literacy</h3>
	
	<p>I found this fun nugget over at <a href="http://www.lisnews.com">LISNews.com</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently, the Aliso Viejo, Calif., city council was so worried about the dangerous properties of dihydrogen monoxide that they almost banned the substance. A hoax website used as the source for the council bill stated "the odorless, tasteless chemical is dangerous when accidentally inhaled."</p>

<p>Yes, it is dangerous when inhaled. But otherwise is pretty nice stuff. I might get  drink of it. I'm thirsty.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/local/states/california/the_valley/8185305.htm">San Jose Mercury News</a> has the story.</p>

	<h3>100th anniversary of NYC Carnegie gift</h3>
	
	<p>In today's <a title="The Writer's Almanac - MARCH 8-14, 2004" href="http://www.writersalmanac.org/docs/04_03_08.htm#friday">Writer's Almanac</a> by Garrison Keiler, it's noted:</p>

<blockquote>"On this day in 1901, industrialist Andrew Carnegie gave New York City 5.2 million dollars to construct sixty-five libraries. 

<p>"He had just sold the Carnegie Steel Company to J. P. Morgan for 250 million dollars, and decided to retire and devote himself to giving it all away. </p>

<p>"He later donated money to create more than 2,500 libraries all over the United States and Britain. By the time he died, Carnegie had given away over 350 million dollars. </p>

<p>"He said, "The man who enters a library is in the best society this world affords; the good and the great welcome him, surround him, and humbly ask to be allowed to become his servants."</blockquote></p>

<p>More thoughts on this later</p>

	<h3>Egyptian goose followup</h3>
	
	<p>When we saw an Egyptian goose  on our riverfront (photo at left) we were curious how a native African bird could end up on the Ohio River. <a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/archives/000274.html">(read earlier post)</a></p>

<p>Thus I sent an email to the Louisville Zoo asking if they had an idea how he could have gotten here.</p>

<p>Here is the response:</p>

<blockquote>Mr. Yarnetsky, I have just received an answer from our lead Bird-keeper, Mr. Johnson. 

<p>Yes, the photo is indeed an Egyptian goose. Mr. Johnson does not think that it is from the Zoo.  Egyptian Geese are pretty common in Kentucky through mail order companies.  They are usually also found for sale at the Kentucky State Fair each week.</p>

<p>Good eye in spotting the bird!<br />
Gary Michael</blockquote></p>

<p>An unusual find, but apparently not THAT unusual. We'll take a sacred Egyptian bird on our riverfront nonetheless.</p>

	<h3>New uses for book carts</h3>
	
	<p>There was a group of teens in the library today joy riding in the elevator (real excitement in a small town I'm sure). I went around the library to make sure they weren't hopping off in staff areas. </p>

<p>I never found them, but down in the basement I found two other kids. One was sitting a book carts as the other was pushing him around down the non-fiction video aisle. Not that a 100 pounds of boy would do much damage, but it might violate our warrentee.</p>

<p>"You don't want us riding on this?" Good question.<br />
"No, it's library property."<br />
Poof they disappeared.</p>

	<h3>'Texas governor's race gets Kinky'</h3>
	
	<p>OK, I'm glad I read the newspaper. <br />
The <a title="HoustonChronicle.com - Texas governor's race gets Kinky" href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/metropolitan/2433090">Houston Chronicle</a> is reporting that author Kinky Friedman is planning to run for Texas governor as an independent in 2006.</p>

<blockquote>"There are no skeletons in my closet. They are all bleaching on a beach somewhere," he said.   

<p>You want to know Kinky's stand on gun control?  "I do not carry a gun myself, so if someone is going to shoot me, they better remember to bring their own weapon."   </p>

<p>On abortion?  "I am not pro-life, I am not pro-choice, I am pro football."</blockquote>   <br />
Do I have to wait until 2006? I could use some of this levity this year.</p>

	<h3>GOP calling the kettle black</h3>
	
	<p>I should stop reading the newspaper. It just gets my blood boiling. </p>

<p><a title="Two Blamed for Senate Computer Snooping" href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/national/AP-Judiciary-Memos.html">Two Republican Senate aides</a> are blamed for computer snooping and conservatives are blaming the Democrats.</p>

<p>The two aides snagged hundreds upon hundreds of confidential files from a Democratic computer server after one of them learned how to get in by watching a systems administrator.</p>

<p>The aides excuse? The files weren't protected well. If the guys watched an office worker punch in a door combination then used the same combo to walk in and get papers, it would be theft and B&E.</p>

<p>In the meantime, conservatives are calling for an investigation into the content of the stolen memos. They say the Demcrats "colluded" with liberal political groups to block conservative judicial nominees-- specifically conservative minority nominees.</p>

<p>Well, they can have their so-called "investigation." </p>

<p>While they're at it, maybe they can also find out:<br />
<li>Who <a href="http://www.prospect.org/webfeatures/2004/02/kuttner-r-02-26.html">Vice President Dick Chaney</a> "colluded" with when he created the administration's energy policy. <br />
<li>Why Chaney can still profit from Haliburton on stock options even as the company reams the military for millions upon millions.<br />
<li>Who outted Vicki Plame as a CIA operative and who knew of the smear campaign.<br />
<li>Why the National Security Council was discussing invading Iraq just days after walking into the Oval Office for the first time.</p>

<p>Leave it up to the GOP to call a kettle black when their own kettle is whistling with boiling water.</p>

		<h2>03.04.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>You gotta wonder about their priorities</h3>
	
	<p>The Bush administration was so busy setting up the Iraq war that they repeatedly refused to <a title="MSNBC - Avoiding attacking suspected terrorist mastermind" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4431601/">attack a suspected terrorist mastermind</a> even when there was an "airtight" case the Al Queda related cell was working on chemical weapons.</p>

<p>Abu Musab Zarqawi. a Jordanian militant, is now blamed for 700 deaths in Iraq and is still at large. We could have had him.</p>

<p>This is a perfect example of why I didn't favor the Iraq war. Bush & Co. were so busy with "their" war that they weren't fighting "our" war.</p>

	<h3>Civil Rights. Will it happen in our generation?</h3>
	
	<p>Gov. A.S. of California should consider himself lucky he's not facing the Junior State legislature. According to a <a title=" sacbee.com -- Politics -- Cold reception for gay wedding ban " href="http://www.sacbee.com/content/politics/story/8363005p-9292831c.html">Sacramento Bee</a> article, the Northern California Junior State convention overwhelmingly approved allowing gay marriage. This much to the chagrin of Republican State Senator Pete Knight who had hoped to convince them otherwise.</p>

<p>Knight is quoted as hoping the students' opinions will change as they get older. Polls, however, don't give him much hope. In a Field Poll, 58 percent of 18-26 year olds favor gay marriage compared to 26 percent of those over 65.</p>

<p>In my mind this is a good sign. This is a somewhat naive statement, but it seems each generation buries the boogiemen of the previous generation. Persecuted immigrant groups are accepted, taboos are legalized. I'm remembering that inter-racial marriage was illegal not that long ago.</p>

<p>For me it boils down to a human rights question. There is no excuse for any person being unable to designate another person to safe guard their rights, to talk on their behalf, to inherit their property upon death. If I'm in the hospital, I want my "other half" to be there to comfort me and to talk to doctors. </p>

<p>In my case, that's obviously Darlene. But what about Dick Chaney's daughter? Should she not have the same right?</p>

<p>I'm not sure what the answer is. It's probably somewhere in the middle as is the case with many issues. </p>

<p>Maybe it's time for the church alone to worry about "marriage." This way Protestants, Jews, Catholics, Orthodox, Hindus, Buddists and Muslims can all have total freedom in consecrating marriage in their own ways. Freedom of religion.</p>

<p>In turn, maybe the states could authorize "household corporations." Any human can enter into a household corporation with any other human for the purposes of common wealth and health. Maybe it wouldn't be limited to "couples." This way your two widowed aunts could take care of each in old age legally as well as spiritually.</p>

<p>Darlene and I? We were married by a pair of ministers and are very happy to have been blessed by God in our union. Nonetheless, maybe you can call us "Yarnetsky, Inc."</p>

<p>Any of this is obviously open to debate for years to come-- though I'm amazed at already hearing Bush allow for the possibility of civil unions--how the debate quickly shifts.</p>

<p>In the meantime, let's stop ignoring the education of millions of children and the jobs of a millions of employees and the welfare of our fine planet, which should bloom in our neck of the woods anytime now.</p>
