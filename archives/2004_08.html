	<h3>Only at a library...</h3>
	
	<p>could this possibly happen.  </p>

<p>We got a video returned today where the box was chewed to pieces by a dog. </p>

<p>Fortunately, the video was in one piece, but we were all rolling when we discovered the title. "Basic Dog Obedience." It apparently failed to have an impact. </p>

<p>Maybe the human should have been watching it instead of the dog.</p>

	<h3>Hundreds of thousands? Wow...</h3>
	
	<p>I expected big protests in New York, but I never expected hundreds of thousands marching through Manhattan. </p>

<p><a title="The New York Times > Washington > Campaign 2004 > Marchers Denounce Bush as They Pass G.O.P. Convention Hall" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/29/politics/campaign/29CND-PORT.html?hp">The New York Times</a> has general coverage including this classic quote:</p>

<blockquote>A group of older women calling themselves the Raging Grannies from Rochester, N.Y., sang to the tune of the "Battle Hymn of the Republic": "No more lies from Dick and Georgie, we deplore their wartime orgy."</blockquote>

	<h3>Mother Nature vs. Dubya</h3>
	
	<p>My father-in-law who lives outside of Lima, Ohio, reports that Dubya was speaking there today.</p>

<p>He watched Bush on the local Lima station speaking at the new high school when a huge storm rolled in and knocked out the power toward the end of his speech.</p>

<p>He then apparently couldn't get out of town on the pre-planned blockade route because of flash-flooding as more than 2 inches of rain fell in 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Hmmm.... is mother nature trying to tell us something? Don't we wish. Anyway it'd be lost on Lima which is very Republican-- so much so that every Republican nominee has visited the town.</p>

<p>You can access the paper's website at <a href="http://www.limanews.com">LimaNews.com</a> Unfortunately, the site didn't work quite right with my Mac browser so I couldn't verify the information with the paper.</p>

	<h3>Games for Change</h3>
	
	<p>OK, so watching Kerry's lead slowly disappear causes one to growl and fret. So Bush has managed to avoid talking about the issues for a couple weeks which, again, causes one to growl and fret. So what?</p>

<p>Thinking about it for a couple of days though, I get the feeling that after the convention Bush will peak out at about 50% support and watch it dwindle away.</p>

<p>Bush has to deal with failures across the board and new ones that keep popping up left and right. He won't be able to control the tempo of the debate. His supporters will go "nucular" with attacks against Kerry and while that will keep some of the electorate undecided, it won't improve Bush's standings. Recent polls are proving that.</p>

<p>The key I think is whether Bush can actually run on his record and offer something to a country that has said it distinctly wants change.</p>

<p>None of this is original thinking. Read <a href="http://www.dailykos.com">Daily Kos</a> and you'll come to the same conclusions.</p>

<p>I think fretting is the result of being blue in a red state, you get the feeling living here there isn't much you can do about it all. However, I think stealing an idea from MoveOn will help.  A couple in Massachusettes held a "Games for Change" night as a fundraiser. </p>

<p>We can get a bunch of folks who want some change in the country together here in America's most beautiful rivertown and play games to raise money. Everyone can play games and bid on how they'll go (the bids don't have to be even) and all winnings go into a central pot. Playing volleyball. "We'll bet $2 that we'll make the next point." Win or lose the money goes into the kitty. Start with sports and finish with cards. </p>

<p>Maybe we can decide on a destination for the money up front, maybe we'll hold a vote halfway through the evening as to where the money will go. The DNC? MoveOn? ACT? Congressional candidates? a percentage to each?</p>

<p>The bottom line is we'll have a blast, figure out who we can comiserate with and we'll raise some change for change.</p>

	<h3>Science Friday: The Precautionary Principal</h3>
	
	<p>The British website Spiked has an article about the Precautionary Principal that is rather interesting. Basically we're <a title="spiked-risk | Article | More sorry than safe" href="http://www.spiked-online.com/Articles/0000000CA592.htm">more sorry than safe</a> is we constantly hedge from taking incremental risks to stay safe:</p>

<blockquote>Berry points to the restrictions imposed on DDT - the pesticide used to get rid of malaria-carrying mosquitoes - as another example of how the 'application of precaution' can cause death and disease. In some third world countries where malaria had been all but eradicated over the past 20 years, there have been epidemics of the disease since DDT was restricted. Currently malaria is on the rise in all the tropical regions of the planet; in 2000, it killed more than one million and made 300million seriously ill. 'Campaigners claimed that DDT was bad for the environment; they said that it caused harm to American birds of prey. I'm sorry, but why should people in the third world at risk from malaria care about American birds of prey? Decisions about these things should be based on local needs and on empirical evidence.'
</blockquote>

<p>I suspect anyone interested in the stem-cell research debate would find this an interesting article.<br />

	<h3>Welcome to the chess match</h3>
	
	<p>I think people are starting to realize that slime is part of greater Bushco's general methods of operation. </p>

<p>Depending on what kind of attack comes next, Kerry may have partial immunity and be able to pull off a Reagan "there you go again."</p>

<p>However, I think Bush may have won this round by avoiding having to fight the round.</p>

<p>In his Cooper Union speech, Kerry was right about the biggest loss in the Swifty fiasco. Discussion of the issues has come to a halt in this campaign.</p>

<p>Bush has largely been able to avoid intense coverage of increasing poverty, declining health insurance and reports about Abu Graib. He's able to keep the negatives to a minimum as he's about to grab the convention limelight. </p>

<p>The coverage is there, but Kerry can't pounce on it when he's awash in defending against the slime. </p>

<p>Similarly, this is turning into a big chess match. Everyone attacking the Swifties has in turn given Bush the platform to hammer against Moveon, et al. </p>

<p>I don't know if the public is getting enough information from the "so-called liberal media" to know the difference between Moveon and the Swifties. (The swifties have few huge contributors, Moveon has thousands upon thousands of small contributors).</p>

<p>Thus, I think Bush might be getting away with whitewashing all the groups as "shadowy."</p>

<p>Again, the ability to avoid bad coverage. I'll credit him there, but I don't think his luck can last forever.</p>

	<h3>Site being tweaked again</h3>
	
	<p>I wanted a new goose on the site. Looking into the sun, this fellow seems to be an optimistic sort. I also wanted a look that'd work better on smaller screens. Thus I'm goofing off with the layout again so I remember how to write basic CSS and HTML. Mind you right this moment, it's bit boring. It'll get there.</p>

	<h3>Bush not talking to mainline churches?</h3>
	
	<p>I wasn't surprised when Dubya skipped out on the NAACP, but I am shocked that he hasn't spoken with the National Council of Churches. </p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/07/06/evangelicals/">Salon</a>:</p>

<blockquote>"Bush has shown an ideological commitment to the literalist Christian tradition at the expense of the broader view of the larger religious community," said the Rev. Bob Edgar, general secretary of the National Council of Churches, a mainline Protestant group. "He is the first president not to meet with the leadership of mainline Christian traditions since George Washington. We've been able to talk with the prime minister of Britain and the chancellor of Germany, but not our own president. And we would have had some positive things to say," Edgar said, mentioning Bush's $15 billion international HIV-AIDS prevention and treatment program. "But on moral questions, like the morality of going to war, we felt the president should have listened more carefully."</blockquote>

<p>Then again, maybe it's not surprising. But still, these are Methodists, Presbyterians and Episcopalians.</p>

		<h2>08.22.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>At least the press is starting to pay attention</h3>
	
	<p>It's been my impression that the media has been extremely lazy in it's election coverage this year. </p>

<p>Cable television hosts have been seen holding official GOP talking point sheets. Can't they come up with their own analysis and opinion? Reporters accept opposing side views without fact checking them.</p>

<p>Just now they're starting to pay attention to whether the Swift Boaters is fact or fiction. They should have looked into it a long time ago.</p>

<p>At least I'm not the only one feeling that way. The Columbia Journalism Review in its Campaign Desk blog <a title="CJR Campaign Desk: Archives" href="http://www.campaigndesk.org/archives/000844.asp">commented</a> on the press and the media's Swift Boat fiasco:</p>

<blockquote>In a campaign season where the candidates have demonstrated a willingness (even eagerness) to misinform voters, it's the responsibility of the press to inform the public about who's enlightening us with fact and who's misleading us with fiction.</blockquote>

<p>Come on y'all WAKE UP!</p>

	<h3>Here comes the slime</h3>
	
	<p>Man it's going to be a long campaign. I need to remind myself I only have to survive another 72 days of this junk. </p>

<p>I knew the slime would start flying eventually. But now that I've seen the Swift Boat Veterans for the Truth ads, I'm sickened nonetheless.<br />
 <br />
Unlike Bush, I don't believe that independent advertising should be halted. There are viewpoints in the world beyond Bush and Kerry's. Yet those ads should have a measure of truth.</p>

<p>The Swift Boaters obviously have a beef with Kerry and with how they were treated when they returned home from Vietnam. </p>

<p>In interviews the Swift Boat Vets said they felt betrayed by Kerry and his anti-war protests when he returned from Vietnam. The brush Kerry painted on the war, as he described the attrocities that took place in that country, was wide indeed. Rightly or wrongly, the vets felt they were tarred with the same stroke.</p>

<p>If they want to advertise that fact, that is legit. Kerry himself admitted that his protests and testimony before Congress echoed a youthful anger and he wished he had toned down the language. He told the truth, but the result are wounds that, in Larry Thurlow's words, are "still bleeding." This is fact. I feel for these guys, they were honorable men who were trapped in a war gone awry and not of their making.</p>

<p>But to lie about events and take Kerry's words out of context is inexcusable. </p>

<p>The NYTimes, the Washington Post and an editor from the Chicago Tribune, himself was a swift boat captain on the scene, have all refuted the lies. But the Texas GOP moneybags have plenty of money to keep throwing the muck.</p>

<p>I'm not sure I want to know how this will turn out.</p>

<p>(sorry for the lack of links. I've read all this, but I'm tired and don't feel like digging this moment).</p>

	<h3>A candidate visits</h3>
	
	<p>Darlene was downstair wrapping up her pots for the night (she lets them dry as long as she can before wrapping them up) when a couple was intently looking in the window.</p>

<p>She didn't want to be rude, so she invited them in.</p>

<p>Low and behold, it was the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate Marvin Scott. He's a really nice guy and him and his wife likes Darlene's favorite pots. </p>

<p>We had a nice conversation, including politics and pots obviously. I asked him to consider repealing portions of the Patroit Act that allow searches of library and bookstore records (I couldn't resist).</p>

<p>They wanted to buy one of Darlene's sculptures, but they have an 8-year-old at home who had earlier broken a piece of pottery from Peru. They appear to have settled on a box vase and may return for it tomorrow.</p>

<p>Mr. Scott has been campaigning around Indiana like crazy in a rather uphill battle against the incumbent Democrat U.S. Senator Evan Bayh. He attended the Jefferson County Republican Women's annual ice cream social tonight which was held two blocks away along the riverfront.</p>

<p>Again, really nice folks. He's a sociology professor at Butler and his wife teaches at Anderson U. For anyone interested, here's his <a href="http://www.marvinscott.org">campaign website.</a> (See I'm not such a die hard Democrat that I won't give a nice guy a weblink, I'll just make my own voice heard at the polls).</p>

	<h3>Is Bush on the verge of panic?</h3>
	
	<p>While there wasn't a so-called "bounce" from the convention on the national level, there are some pretty amazing trends developing. Indeed, I'm starting to smell blood.</p>

<p>Kerry, while not perfect, has been clearly enjoying himself and attracting astoundingly large crowds during his cross-country tour.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Bush campaign has been a whimper and seems to be on the verge of panic. (Though for equal opportunity, they're saying the Kerry campaign is in panic mode).</p>

<p>Take Oregon.</p>

<p>The photos from Kerry's rally in Portland look more like the Simon & Garfunkle Central Park concert than they do a political rally... more than 50,000 people showed up in the Rose City.... 50,000. </p>

<p>In contrast, the Bush campaign hands out tickets to a select citizens who sign pledges to vote for Bush and has police filter out anyone wearing questionable clothing. Lord forbid if a Democrat or Libertarian were to slipping in. He then holds a scripted "question and answer" session.</p>

<p>Choices of campaign stops is also interesting. Both Kerry and Bush are visiting swing states, but Kerry is visiting Republican cities.  </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com">electoral college</a> is looking very bad for Bush right now -- 327-211 Kerry. </p>

<p>Obviously, swing states such as Ohio, Missouri and Minnesota can swing, but Bush is having trouble holding a lead in states that should be solid Red by now-- we're talking North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas and McCain's Arizona. In Florida, Kerry holds a 47-41 lead.</p>

<p>Bush's "America's turning a corner" stump speech was pulled because jobs numbers took a surprising downward turn and we'll end up with about 1,000 dead Americans in Iraq by time the GOP convention comes around. Meanwhile, we still haven't heard word one of his second term agenda other than allusions to eliminating the income tax and war with Iran.</p>

<p>The result is that we're watching slime fly everywhere. They're trying to slime Kerry's well documented war record (as opposed to Bush who still can't prove he wasn't AWOL) and they're pulling a "Fox" by taking Kerry's words out of context for slime material. </p>

<p>All signs of panic.</p>

<p>Mind you, he still has his convention. While his State of the Union fell flat on its face (do you still hear about Mars?), he may come up with something. There are also in unpredictables. So who knows...</p>

<p>Kerry still needs to fight like he's behind, but I wouldn't be surprised if this is the start of something bigger. Much bigger.</p>

	<h3>Talk about mind numbing disaster</h3>
	
	<p>Mother Nature sure can give us a whipping. Darlene and I have been looking at photos of the devistation from Hurricane Charley and we're numb.</p>

<p>We watched the path and initially feared it would hit our friends who own an inn at Cedar Key (SE of Gainesville well north of Tampa). But, boy did it take an unexpected turn. </p>

<p>I felt bad for one guy who said he felt foolish for spending a few hundred dollars to get out of town further up the coast and came south only to end up in the middle of the hurricane. It was that unexpected.</p>

<p>Our prayers are with y'all. Keep the faith and hang in there.</p>

	<h3>"36 Hours in Buffalo"</h3>
	
	<p>My hometown gets a kiss from The New York Times (same state 400 miles away) via it's travel column "36 Hours."</p>

<p><a title="The New York Times > Travel > Escapes > 36 Hours: Buffalo" href="http://travel2.nytimes.com/2004/08/13/travel/escapes/13HOUR.html?8hpib=&pagewanted=all&position=">36 Hours: Buffalo</a> features most my favorite places-- especially the Elmwood Street shopping district which is truly fun and funky.</p>

<p>Sitting here in Madison-- where summer days often hit the double 90s (90+ temps and 90+ humidity) -- I have often fantasized about Buffalo summers. It's nice to know, however, that my recollections are not just imagination.</p>

<blockquote>The time to visit is summer, when Buffalo gets a glorious payback for its snowy winters with some of the best weather in the nation � three months of mostly sunny, dry days with temperatures in the high 70's and low 80's.</blockquote>

	<h3>A wonderful week</h3>
	
	<p>Our building was once a hotel in the 1870s-80s. For three days it seemed to be a hotel again as Darlene's sister and 7 of her 8 kids came to visit for three days.</p>

<p>It was a blast. They all had a turn on Darlene's pottery wheel. We took them to see Harry Potter at our 1930s movie theatre here in town. Spent a day swimming at our WPA pool.</p>

<p>Yesterday we took them to the Louisville Zoo. Their new butterfly exhibit is pretty impressive. I love the blue morphos. <a href="http://www.louisvillezoo.com/news/events/butterflies.htm">"Thousands of flights daily"</a> through Sept. 30.</p>

<p>Finally we took them canoeing at a nearby lake today before they headed home. </p>

<p>Two of gang accidentally tipped their canoe. They both shifted the same direction at the same time. ooops.</p>

<p>Seeing them go over I entered "protective uncle" mode and went to the rescue. Actually, I amazed myself by remembering how to right a flooded canoe in deep water from a single canoe. I read about it years ago and had never done it before, but it worked. </p>

<p>They were laughing and having fun. In a way I wish I had let them enjoy it a little more. Instead I ordered them around a bit so I could get them out of the water and save the canoe.</p>

<p>Everyone seemed to have a fun vacation either way. It was great to see them. They're growing so fast. </p>

<p>Finally, I got a new wireless router. Boy the thing was a royal pain to set up. It's why I hate PCs. Apple routers are simple in comparison, but they're between models for another few weeks so I bought a cheapy to hold me over. In the end I gave up and called tech support. But at least I'm up and running again.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> Thinking back over the mini-vacation with the kids, one of my favorite times was during the credits of "Harry Potter." </p>

<p>Our friend was the manager that night and she told us we could go up on stage and play in the light. So I went up with all the kids and we all shadow boxed, danced and generally made fools of ourselves. Never in my life has that opportunity presented itself and boy did we take advantage of it.</p>

	<h3>A new "Bushism"</h3>
	
	<p>To welcome another Friday, I present President Bush's latest <a title="MSNBC - A new 'Bushism': We're gonna get us" href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/5613296/">fun quote</a>:<br />
<blockquote>�Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we,� Bush said. �They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we."</blockquote><br />

	<h3>Now no wireless... sigh</h3>
	
	<p>After a few days of high speed bliss, my wireless station got fried during a storm we had here Friday night.</p>

<p>Apparently, the first generation of Apple's Airport base station has a problem with weak capacitors. So now I'm looking for a new wireless router. Unfortunately, the one I want has a two week wait....</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we're cleaning our building like crazy as we're expecting Darlene's sister Carol and 7 of her 8 kids. Mudcat Building population will go up 5 fold for four days.</p>

<p>I've been enjoying Internet radio. My favorite find so far is Virgin Radio. Good stuff and very British.</p>

<p>That storm was weird with 40mph winds coming in from the south. For the first time since we owned the building we had rain coming in our open windows on the south side. Result? Our kitchen and bathroom were totally flooded. Fun? Wow...</p>
