	<h3>Gotta like Google</h3>
	
	<p>Wired News today outlines why Google's Initial Public Offering is so unusual in it's web article <a title="Wired News: More Reasons to Love Google" href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,63286-2,00.html?tw=wn_story_page_next1">More Reasons to Love Google</a>.</p>

<p>Here's a sampling...<br />
<blockquote>If you take a close look at the form Google filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the exact value of its planned offering is $2,718,281,828 dollars, which some would immediately recognize as the mathematical constant e. E, for those not blessed with a Ph.D. and a job at Google, is Euler's number, which is used as the base for natural logarithms.</blockquote></p>

<p>Along with everyone else, I was worried the IPO would ruin the company as Wall Street has ruined so many other good companies during the tech boom. Some companies deal with the pressure of measuring up to quarterly earning expectations better than others. Those that didn't fudged numbers up the wazoo in the 90s.</p>

<p>But I'm encouraged. Google is flat out telling Wall Street in its <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312504073639/ds1.htm"> IPO statmenet</a> it doesn't want to play the numbers game and prefers to focus on the long-run health of the company and maintaining employees with perks such as free eats (boy that'd be nice).</p>

	<h3>Forgotten Buffalo</h3>
	
	<p>To even things up, here's some forgotten Buffalo to go with the forgotten New York.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.buffalohistoryworks.com">Buffalo History Works</a> is a really neat history site about my home town.</p>

<p>Buffalo is really a pretty amazing town with nice architecture, funky shopping, great eating and some world-class museums. However, it's also lost a lot during the era of "urban renewal." </p>

<p>While there are a couple Frank Lloyd Wright Homes still standing in Buffalo such as the newly renovated <a href="http://www.darwinmartinhouse.org">Darwin Martin House</a>, the <a href="http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Larkin_Building.html">Larkin Building</a> <a href="http://www.pbs.org/flw/buildings/larkin/larkin.html">(more)</a> was lost. </p>

<p>I remember seeing pictures of turn of the century Buffalo that had downtown streets lined with magificent buildings that are now all gone. </p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, there are still some really cool edifices-- such as the shot from movie "Bruce Almighty" where Jim Carrey is standing atop a Buffalo skyscrapper. We also have an awesome <a href="http://ah.bfn.org/a/church/28/guar.html">Louis Sullivan building</a>. Check out the <a href="http://ah.bfn.org/a/bamname.html">Buffalo as an Architectural Museum</a> webpage.</p>

<p>Another gem that's all but lost is Buffalo's <a href="http://www.buffalohistoryworks.com/terminal/Welcome.html">Central Terminal</a> that served as the main railroad station for several decades. It was beautiful, but it's now rather decayed-- though still beautiful. This website is on of my favorites. It's <a href="http://www.buffalohistoryworks.com/terminal/youare/here.html">haunting</a>.</p>

	<h3>Interesting New York</h3>
	
	<p>I'm still trying to figure out how I ended up at this website, but it is pretty darn cool. This guy collected photos and stories behind anything you'd never expect to see or had been totally forgotten about in New York City.</p>

<p>From old subway stations to lamp posts and Buffalo in New York (I was born in Buffalo, NY, but this is actually bison in New York City).</p>

<p>See it all in <a href="http://www.forgotten-ny.com/">Forgotten-NY</a></p>

	<h3>There they go again</h3>
	
	<p>If there was a man who avoided service in Vietnam and left the National Guard without completing his service, you'd think he'd keep his mouth shut about the service of others.</p>

<p>No, instead he tries to knock them down a notch or two so he doesn't look AS bad.</p>

<p>While I guess this makes good politics, but it's as close to being as slimy as you can get.</p>

<p>John McCain, Max Cleland and John Kerry all went overseas and killed for our country. They watched their compatriots be killed. Between the three of them, they've seen enough blood for a lifetime times three.</p>

<p>Hardly anyone in the current administration outside Powell and the Pentagon has seen a fraction of their service. Yet, they're on a tear to smear them.</p>

<p>The Bush folks in 2000 started what many call a "whisper campaign" questioning McCain's <a href="http://dir.salon.com/politics/feature/2001/05/31/jeffords/index.html">"mental stability"</a> coming back from Vietnam.</p>

<p>In TV ads they compared triple-amputee Max Cleland to <a href="http://www.macon.com/mld/macon/4264879.htm">Osama Bin-Laden.</a></p>

<p>I know he tried smearing Gore's service as well, but I can't find an article right this moment. </p>

<p>Now there's an underground campaign saying John Kerry didn't deserve this third Purple Heart stating <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/1519/4739243.html">he wasn't injured enough.</a> </p>

<p>Good grief. Kerry requested to go to Vietnam. He put his life on the line time after time to fulfill his missions and protect the soldiers under his command. He did and all the other troops that were there did. Each and every one of them should be honored.</p>

<p>Bush and his crew, avoided all of it. Who is he to sling any slime? Yet, here they are slinging it again.</p>

<p>What can I say it makes me growly.</p>

	<h3>In Bushworld</h3>
	
	<p>There are so many reasons why the Bush administration doesn't make any sense. As news comes up with another reason to shake my head I struggle with how to convey my thoughts. </p>

<p>(That's besides the fact that Darlene and I have been busy as all get out the last couple weeks getting ready for the grand open house of her <a href="http://www.mudcatpottery.com">pottery</a>) </p>

<p>But the New York Times' Maureen Dowd has found a creative means of writing the laundry list. Read about Bushworld in her column <a title="The New York Times > Opinion > Op-Ed Columnist: The Orwellian Olsens" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/25/opinion/25DOWD.html">"The Orwellian Olsens"</a></p>

	<h3>Snow in mid-April???</h3>
	
	<p><img alt="snow out our window" src="http://www.ontheriversedge.com/archives/snowoutourwindow.jpg" width="300" height="203" border="1" /></p>

<p>You have to understand that this is an area where we get dafodils and tulips in mid-March. Winter end there.</p>

<p>But on Tuesday it snowed, covering blooming dogwoods and redbuds with heavy, slushy snow.</p>

<p>While I was attending the Indiana Library Federation annual conference in Indianapolis, an odd front moved through that dumped 2-6 inches of really wet, heavy snow along the Ohio River valley upriver from Louisville. </p>

<p>My boss and I were driving down I-65 when it started raining hard as we left Indy. Sometime after we passed Columbus, Ind., Charlene asked "what is that stuff." The white stuff was only in patches, but as we drove further south it piled up. </p>

<p>By the time we got off the Interstate onto IN-256 it was obvious we had a mid-spring snow storm. Cars and trucks were spun off the road. Soon we caught up to the snow plow that sent plumes of snow (and several trash cans) 20 feet into the air.</p>

<p>The bushes were heavy with snow, green leaves and flowers pokes out from the snow. It was quite beautiful.</p>

<p>I wish I had actually witnessed the event unstead of the after effects.</p>

<p>Darlene said it started with rain and turned to a heavy sleet. Soon silver dollar-sized flakes fell in the heaviest snow seen the whole year.</p>

<p>Darlene said her favorite, though sad episode of the snow was a police car who flew down Main Street toward a wreck on the west end of town. As he crossed the railroad bridge, he hit black ice, spun out and hit a car. That car hit another car and that car hit a house.</p>

<p>The next morning I biked to work, the snow was already gone a mid-spring night's dream.</p>

	<p>The Japanese companies in our city donate a number of blossoming cherry trees that are on our riverfront. They are beautiful right now, every branch is enveloped with blooms. Darlene took this photo yesterday.</p>

	<h3>No she didn't</h3>
	
	<p>My mom recently read about my <a href="http://www.ontheriversedge.com/archives/000292.html">"slide incident."</a></p>

<p>I asked her if she ever warned me about running up slides. "No, I never told you not to." </p>

<p>At least I don't have to worry about disobeying my mother to boot. Being that dumb is bad enough.</p>

<p>The swelling in the upper lip is almost gone, but my nose still hurts.</p>

<p>For some reason it reminds me of a bike riding accident I had as a kid. </p>

<p>I was rolling over a railroad track that went at an angle to the street when my front tire got stuck on the rail. It threw me over the handlebars into a patch of tall reedy grass on the side of the street. </p>

<p>I was fine with one exception. One of the reeds went up my nose.</p>

<p>It turned out my dad had to take me to the hospital because the profuse bleeding just would not stop.</p>

<p>I guess if there's a lesson in any of that, it's to not carry a bag full of Richie Rich comic books while you're riding a bike over railroad tracks. I'm lucky the guy I borrowed them from was a friend, several ended up with blood on them.</p>

		<h2>04.07.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Didn't your mother tell you not to run up slides?</h3>
	
	<p>I'm not sure, I don't remember. But experience certainly did last night.<br />
Actually, I lucked out as I narrowly avoided breaking my nose or my teeth.</p>

<p>We were at a picnic celebrating a friend leaving his job. I was playing tag with his kids and a few others hanging out at the playground. I went up a slide to chase one of the kids and slammed into the slide's metal hold bar. I never saw it-- of course it was painted the same color as the rest of the slide</p>

<p>I'm amazed it got it on the upper lip. A quarter inch up or down and I'd have been in the emergency room. My upper lip is a little split and definitely fat. But hey, my mustache hides the worst of it.</p>

<p>Mind you, the evening stayed in that mode. </p>

<p>One of their kids did a literal back flip off the merry-go-round learning his first lesson in centrifical force. He got back on, though holding on very tight, a few minutes later.</p>

<p>Later, while playing UNO, the "unjob" celebrant dropped his playing card in his pop. Darlene threw a paper wad at another friend and it landed in her pop (she couldn't have hit it if she tried). </p>

<p>At least his wife, who's expecting their third any day now, didn't go into labor.</p>

	<h3>snippets on 4.4.4</h3>
	
	<p>The old Chinese fortune cookie curse goes something like "You will lead an interesing life."</p>

<p>It has been that.</p>

<p>We went to our nephews wedding which was very nice and as we were about to pack, Darlene's father had a heart attack. We spent three days with family and in the hospital until her dad got out of the coronary care unit. He has more surgery in his future near and far, but he survived the attack with no damage to the heart because they got him to the hospital so quick.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we hoped to have a quiet weekend to catch up, but our friend Pat was in the mood to build and we now have three new sets of shelves in her studio and other sundry improvements to our building.</p>

<p>Meanwhile at work I've got a full slate of projects, I'll need to work on a massive to-do list because I can't keep it all in my mind. I'm astounded at how far I can fall behind having missed four days of work.</p>

<p>I also learned we were awarded the full amount of the grant I wrote for wireless Internet at the library. We'll be able to offer it to the public as well as make access easier for staff. We'll indeed be a hot spot.</p>

<p>On the pottery side, Darlene's planning a <a href="www.mudcatpotterycom">Grand Open House</a> for the end of the month in her studio. She's cleaning like a madwoman and plans to make pots like crazy as well. There should be some fun stuff coming out of the kilns so stop by if you can.</p>
