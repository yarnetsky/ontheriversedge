	<h3>Politics as unusual</h3>
	
	<p>To avoid being blue in a red state, I've been making <a href="calls.johnkerry.com">phone calls</a> for the Kerry-Edwards campaign. </p>

<p>It's a cool idea actually. Local organizers don't have the ability to reach out to every possible volunteer in the area-- especially in urban areas. Thus, they recruit folks from red states to help with the calling.</p>

<p>Of what I've read, the results have been beyond imagining. A canvassing captain in Florida expected about 40 folks to show up, but his event was on the calling list the night before and he ended up with more than 125 ready to go door-to-door.</p>

<p>Most of the calls I've made have been messages on answering machines, but it's been a lot of fun talking to KE supporters from battleground states. I talked to a couple pumped supporters who had attended the Kerry event in Madison, Wisc., that attracted 100,000. </p>

<p>It's also been fun because people are enthusiastic to talk with me. There was a cute machine message that said they'd try their "best" to return the call, but if I was a salesman to give it a "rest." I laughed and said I wasn't quite a salesman that I was a KE volunteer. They quickly answered the phone and said I didn't have to do any salesmanship that they had five Kerry voters in the household. Two of them will volunteer to boot. Priceless.</p>

<p>I finally had to quit tonight because they rain out of phone numbers to call!</p>

<p>Meanwhile we had another good weekend of sales in the shop. It didn't hurt that the Indiana Main Street Conference was in town. Good times.</p>

<p>Also here's followup to a recent post, here is an update on recent <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2004/10/31/192155/73">voter fraud and disenfranchisement</a> efforts by the Republicans.</p>

<p>I smell desperation.</p>

		<h2>10.28.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>A play on numbers</h3>
	
	<p>Darlene just pointed something out that I had been noticing lately.</p>

<p>An Associated Press article in the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-10-28-campaign-rdp_x.htm">USA Today</a> stated:</p>

<blockquote>Five days before Election Day, the polls were close and the crowds huge. Looking out at 10,000 faces at a Bush rally, failed GOP presidential candidate Bob Dole quipped, "I couldn't get a crowd like this in 1996."   .....   Pop culture merged with politics as rocker Bruce Springsteen endorsed Kerry and sang at the Massachusetts senator's rally in Madison, Wis., that drew thousands.</blockquote>

<p>They'll give numbers for Bush and not Kerry? So... how many showed up in Madison?</p>

<p><img alt="capt.sge.bav35.281004194301.photo01.photo.default-273x373.jpg" src="http://www.ontheriversedge.com/images/capt.sge.bav35.281004194301.photo01.photo.default-273x373.jpg" width="273" height="373" border="0" /></p>

<p><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/041028/photos_ts_afp/041028194311_m9znkxio_photo1">AFP Photo from Yahoo.com</a></p>

<p><br />
<blockquote>Madison Assistant Fire Chief Carl Saxe told <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=1506&ncid=696&e=4&u=/afp/20041028/ts_alt_afp/us_vote_kerry">AFP</a> that at least 80,000 people were in the main crowd, while, at least 20,000 more were trying to get in on sidestreets, making the rally the biggest event in Madison's history.</blockquote></p>

<p>Hmmm... would you call this "thousands?"</p>

<p>We've been noticing the same thing with polls as well. If Bush is up by a point they write something to the effect of Bush surges ahead. When Kerry is up by 3, they write "candidates in a dead heat."</p>

<p>Amazing...</p>

	<h3>A nice coincidence</h3>
	
	<p>During a lunar eclipse, the Boston Red Sox finally break the Curse during the 100th World Series. Nice. Very nice.</p>

<p>Headline from <a title="Boston.com" href="http://www.boston.com/">The Boston Globe</a> right after the game: "AT LAST! Pigs can fly, hell is frozen, the slipper finally fits, and Impossible Dreams really can come true. The Red Sox have won the World Series"</p>

<p>Our favorite comment in a baseball thread at dailykos.com: "Who's still here? That was the rapture wasn't it?"</p>

<p>I wonder if John Kerry will have a little extra bounce to his step tomorrow.</p>

		<h2>10.26.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Where's Jimmy Carter when you need him?</h3>
	
	<p>While I'm somewhat discouraged that my vote won't particularly count toward the electoral college, I am glad not to be living in Ohio. Or should I say, I'm glad I won't be voting in Ohio.</p>

<p>I've been reading about the Republican strategy for winning the White House and, to be honest, it has nothing to do with winning. Essentially it has everything to do with keeping as many Democrats away from the polls as possible. To have any chance they need to keep the vote down. </p>

<p>In Ohio, the GOP has 8,000 Jim Crow-style challengers lined up to contest as many voters as possible. Even if that doesn't disqualify many people, it is intended to reduce the process to molassas with the hopes of getting voters discouraged and making them leave. And when Kerry does win, they plan to argue that they couldn't stop the voting fraud and claim that Kerry stole the election.</p>

<p>Thus the period after the election may well be more disgusting than the period prior to the election. Sometimes I wonder if we need some UN election observers to keep this thing fair. (note: I just saw that Ohio's Secretary of State has refused foreign observes, a first.)</p>

<p>I think it's fair to say that no one wants voter fraud. I want a fair election. Yet, I have a problem with anyone trying to supress the vote. The Democrats have focused on creating greater participation and in getting out the vote. Isn't that what democracy is about? Voters participating?</p>

<p>Here's a website that is tracking all of the <a href="http://vote2004.eriposte.com/">voter supression</a> activities.</p>

<p>Also, here are a couple articles out of the dozens that are emerging on the problem from the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/3956129.stm">BBC</a> and the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A62645-2004Oct25.html">Washington Post</a>. Oh yes, now there are <a href="http://www.local10.com/politics/3854230/detail.html">58,000 absentee ballots missing</a> in Broward Co., Florida. </p>

<p>This all stinks like rotten fish to me. Darlene and I contributed to the cause already, but I'm starting to think we'll have to contribute to the legal defense fund as well.</p>

		<h2>10.25.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Speaking of a lack of a plan...</h3>
	
	<p><i><b>Editor's note</b>: I've been trying to get Darlene to blog with me for a while now. So finally, this is her first entry. I have no idea if she'll ever contribute another, but I'll take what I can get.</i></p>

<p><br />
I would say this tidbit dovetails well with what Fahrenheit 911 implied was the White House's real reason for going to war in Iraq- it certainly clarifies where their priorities were in the aftermath.</p>

<p>Here is Bush's press secretary McClellan from today's White House press briefing answering questions about the recently revealed 380 tons of missing explosives in Iraq since the war began:</p>

<blockquote>Q But after Iraqi Freedom, there were those caches all around, wasn't the multinational force -- who was responsible for keeping track --

<p> MR. McCLELLAN: At the end of Operation Iraqi Freedom there were a number of priorities. It was a priority to make sure that the oil fields were secure, so that there wasn't massive destruction of the oil fields, which we thought would occur. It was a priority to get the reconstruction office up and running. It was a priority to secure the various ministries, so that we could get those ministries working on their priorities, whether it was -</p>

<p> Q So it was the multinational force's responsibility --</p>

<p> MR. McCLELLAN: There were a number of -- well, the coalition forces, there were a number of priorities at the end of Operation Iraqi Freedom.</blockquote></p>

<p>So there it is.  The priorities of the White House were securing oil fields and getting the reconstruction started.  Never mind that it only took less than one pound of this type of explosive to blow up the Lockerbie plane.</p>

<p>The quotes from the meeting were posted on <a href="http://www.dailykos.com">dailykos.com</a> this morning.  I followed the link to read more of the discussion.  Plenty of stonewalling.  A comment that there many munitions that were secured (true, but 380 tons missing can do an endless amount of damage)  What this boils down to was that there were not enough troops available to secure the country.  Period.</p>

<p>Looking forward to voting Bush out of office in 8 days,<br />
Darlene</p>

	<h3>Big dog speaks volumes</h3>
	
	<p>The photos from Philadelphia are absolutely amazing. I was impressed with 40,000 in Portland and 30,000 in Minneapolis, but it blows my mind that more than 80,000 people would turn out for a political rally. Here's a snipet from Clinton's speach...</p>

<blockquote>"In the closing days of this campaign, John Kerry is going on being John Kerry -- talking about his hopes for America; his plans for America; his commitment to our security and our prosperity. 

<p>Now, one of Clinton's laws of politics is this, if one candidate's trying to scare you, and the other one is trying to get you to think, if one candidate is appealing to your fears and the other one is appealing to your hopes, you better vote for the person who wants you to think and hope."</blockquote></p>

<p>He may have been a sleeze, but Clinton certainly knows how to capture a certain political truth.</p>

		<h2>10.24.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>In-laws voting and rallying</h3>
	
	<p>Darlene and I visited her parents this weekend. It was a rather interesting weekend to say the least. On one hand it was fun playing with all the nieces and nephews, on the other hand it was a rather political weekend.</p>

<p>Darlene has a split family politically. Her parents are labor Democrats. Two of her sisters are voting for Kerry and the other two are voting for Bush (last time around it was 3-1 Bush I believe). Who knows about her brothers. One would probably vote for Bush, but isn't planning on voting.</p>

<p>Now you know I can get on my high horse and rant away. Darlene is hotter about this election than I am. Her father is twice as growly as Darlene. He has been railing against Bush for three years now, yet oddly he had no plans on voting this year "Why bother? He'll steal the election anyway."</p>

<p>I'm not sure when the last time he had voted. Maybe the 1968 "Humphrey/Muskie" sticker out in his barn gives me a clue. I told him I wouldn't listen to him complain about Bush unless he actually cast a ballot this year. I don't think he believed me until I downloaded the registration forms off the Internet. I think that did it. He actually filled them out and sent them in.</p>

<p>You notice I said "them." I didn't expect my mother-in-law to vote. I've never heard her comment one line about politics in more than 15 years, but during our last visit she said she wanted to vote for Kerry. She had not voted for at least 30 years.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, their registrations were somehow split up. His reached Wapakoneta on Oct. 4 and he sent in their absentee ballot requests soon thereafter. His was granted and hers was not. They said she wasn't registered.</p>

<p>Well at their request, I called the Board of Elections and found out that her registration didn't arrive until Oct. 18, after her request was rejected.</p>

<p>So, Darlene and I had the honor of taking her mom into town to vote for the first time in an eon. While I was at it, I hand delivered her father's ballot to the election board. Two votes for Kerry banked in Ohio.</p>

<p>On the way home we found the Auglaize County Democratic Headquarters open. We stopped and got all kinds of goodies. We got her father a Kerry yard sign. We got a Kerry bumper sticker for our new van and each of us got a Kerry button. Finally, I landed two tickets for today's Edwards rally in Lima, not far from where two of her sisters live.</p>

<p>That night we had a very good turkey for dinner and three of Darlene's sisters came. Politics was obviously the main topic of conversation. I think Darlene was begging for it by wearing her Kerry pin in mixed company.</p>

<p>My wonderful brother-in-law said he believed Bush was the "moral" candidate. What can I say, I lost it on him, lying about war is not moral, Abu Ghraib is not moral, handing down debt and a dirty planet to my nieces and nephews is not moral, instituting Jim Crow type election supression is not moral. Either way, once the ice was broken though, we all had a very civilized, even fun political conversation.</p>

<p>Finally, after everyone went home, we were about to go to bed for the night. It was late and we had to get up early for the four hour drive so I could get to work by 12:30 today. </p>

<p>It was at that point that her father put "Fahrenheit  9-11" into the DVD player. After watching the first 10 minutes were were absolutely hooked. We couldn't stop watching it.</p>

<p>I think it could have been better. There were some connections that could have been made clearer, but the overall impact left me literally shaking. Listening to the parents of the dead soldiers was absolutely heart breaking.</p>

<p>It amazed me that not five months before the 9-11, just about every administration official said, on camera, that Saddam was not a threat. Their story certainly changed. They conveniently took good advantage of the news.</p>

<p>Watching the scenes from Iraq was enlightening. People have told me they do not believe we should know what's going on in a war zone. They don't believe reporters should be there. I disagree, especially after watching the movie. I think everyone should witness a little bit of the carnage. It's good for the soul to see our soldiers put their lives and souls on the line for us. It's good for the soul to see the real impact of war. </p>

<p>Finally, we just heard back from her sister who attended this afternoon's Edwards rally and she sent us a few photos. She said they had a great time. I look forward to hearing what their reaction to Edwards was.</p>

	<h3>There's Joy in Mudville</h3>
	
	<p>If this game and this series doesn't tell the Yankees "go to hell," I'm not sure what does. What an astounding series.</p>

<p><a title="ESPN.com - MLB/PLAYOFFS2004 - Caple: Cheers!" href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs2004/columns/story?columnist=caple_jim&id=1906307">Jim Caple of ESPN said it well:</a></p>

<blockquote>This winter, even if they lose the World Series, Boston fans can take solace in the sweet knowledge that their team somehow pulled off something truly historic, something unprecedented. In the previous 100 postseasons, no team had ever fallen behind 3-0 in a series and rallied to force a seventh game, let alone win it. The Red Sox not only did both, they crushed the Yankees, beating them with a pitcher who required sutures in his ankle in Game 6 and then routing them in a finale that was never close.</blockquote>

<p>I like the parallels I'm seeing here. The Republican Convention was in New York and the Democratic Convention was in Boston.... </p>

<p>Hey, a guy can dream can't he?</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Here's a great quote from the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/21/sports/21yankees.html?hp">New York Times</a>:</p>

<blockquote>It was actually happening. The nerd was kissing the homecoming queen. Paper was beating scissors; scissors were beating rock. Charlie Brown was kicking the football. The Red Sox were beating the Yankees for the American League pennant.</blockquote>

		<h2>10.20.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Oh please, oh please, oh please</h3>
	
	<p>The Boston Red Sox are up 6-0 in the top of the second. Oh please win. This would be the sweetest league championship in history. To be down 3-0 and tie it up is astounding, but to win it in seven. Oh my... Then to have it be the Red Sox, even sweeter.</p>

<p>For starters, I absolutely can't stand the New York Yankees, they always beat my favorite team, the Kansas City Royals. But more than being an "Anybody But the Yankees," fan I root for Boston because a good chunk of my blood is from the area. My dad grew up across the river in Chelsea and much of his family is still in the Boston area. He was a Splendid Splinter fan in his youth. I'm rooting for the Sox.</p>

<p>This would rank higher for me than the Royals coming back from deficits to beat the BlueJays and Cardinals in 1985. This would rank as the biggest self-destruction of a giant in baseball history. Oh please....</p>

<p>A two-run homer in the first and a grand slam (from a former KC Royal) in the second... Oh please...</p>

	<h3>I can't believe we're not signing</h3>
	
	<p><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=519&ncid=519&e=23&u=/ap/20041014/ap_on_re_us/un_population_agenda">Oh Good Grief...</a></p>

<blockquote>The United States has refused to join 85 other heads of state and governments in signing a statement that endorsed a 10-year-old U.N. plan to ensure every woman's right to education, health care, and choice about having children.

<p>President Bush's administration withheld its signature because the statement included a reference to "sexual rights."</p>

<p>U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kelly Ryan wrote to organizers of the statement that that the United States was committed to the Cairo plan of 1994 and "to the empowerment of women and the need to promote women's fullest enjoyment of universal human rights."</p>

<p>"The United States is unable, however, to endorse the world leaders' statement," Ryan said, because it "includes the concept of `sexual rights,' a term that has no agreed definition in the international community."</p>

<p>Ryan did not elaborate on the Bush administration's objections to the phrase "sexual rights," but at past U.N. meetings U.S. representatives have spoken out against abortion, gay rights and what they see as the promotion of promiscuity by giving condoms to young people to prevent AIDS.</blockquote></p>

<p>First, the idea that we preach freedom then refuse to sign this agreement is a farce. </p>

<p>The condom argument is the worst.  Condoms are extraordinarily important, especially in the third world and Africa. To hold up their distribution based on conservative views of procreation is narrow minded at best and tragic to the world's population at worst.</p>

<p>Condoms are not perfect, but for the price they are darn good at providing basic birth control and basic protection against sexually transmitted diseases.</p>

<p>Both are extraordinarily important issues in a region of the world that is experiencing hell due to a combination of over-population, poverty and an AIDS epidemic that is spreading like wildfire. Toss in a frequently occuring famine and a genocide or two and you get the idea.</p>

<p>Now is a time for stemming the epidemic and condoms can cetainly help. This is one instance where an ounce of prevention is worth more than a pound of cure. A one-ounce condom is certainly a lot better than trying to figure out how to pay for a boat load of AIDS medications.</p>

<p>Then, once things have settled down, people will be more willing to listen to some preaching about "the santity of life." But until people stop dying by the boat-load, it won't make much sense.</p>

	<h3>Blog entry No. 249</h3>
	
	<p>OK, I'm a bit fried right now. We are now the proud owners of a black egg. Hmmm, maybe it's a licorice jelly bean. Either way, you call it as you see it, but it's by name a 1995 Toyota Previa DX S/C.</p>

<p><img alt="95prevcar.gif" src="http://www.ontheriversedge.com/images/95prevcar.gif" width="400" height="222" border="0" /></p>

<p>We were expecting a very long search for something reliable when this puppy just showed up in the local paper and its previous owners are regulars at the library. </p>

<p>Darlene is absolutely in love with it. The visibility from the drivers seat is literally panoramic, it handles like a dream and runs like a top.. </p>

<p>I, on the other hand, am so-so on it. The seat has sunken a bit so the back support is a little too high. I need to find a way to sit properly in the thing. Maybe a cushion. It's also not built for someone who's six-foot. I don't quite have the leg room I'm used to.</p>

<p>At the very least Darlene has a vehicle she'll love and I hope I can get used to it.<br />
___________<br />
I had just written a whole bunch more stuff, but I accidentally lost it when I hit the wrong key combination. I'm using Windows so often at work that keep hitting the wrong keys. I was reaching for "control" instead of the "command." Oh well, maybe I'll write it better the second time around.</p>

	<h3>Now doing the floor</h3>
	
	<p>Improvements are once again starting to occur at the Mudcat Building.</p>

<p>About two years ago we replaced the roof on our building's warehouse annex. It should have been replaced 20 years ago. Water was pouring through it so bad, it might as well been without a roof entirely.</p>

<p>The flooring was similarly shot by having water pour down. Now, two years later, we're attacking the floor.</p>

<p>Yesterday we took out the extraneous layers of OSB fiberboard in order to get down to the original flooring. We hoped the bottom layer would be in good enough shape to simply build on top of it. However, it too was pretty well shot so then we pulled up all the boards on half the floor. This exposed the beams, a couple of which are covered with mushrooms. We'll replace those too *sigh*</p>

<p>We had to drag all that wood out of the warehouse and then get it cut up so our friend could use it as firewood this winter. This was an exhausting process, but it beats having to pay for a dumpster.</p>

<p>I managed to work eight hours without hurting myself (which I rarely do anymore, but I still live with the alleged reputation of getting hurt in weird ways). I'm rather sore this morning, but what should I expect?</p>

<p>We'll post photos as soon as I manage to get them out of the camera. It's a rather impressive looking space. In New York City, the loft alone would go for a cool million easily. Mind you this is Madison.</p>

<p>This is a keystone project for us. Finishing this will allow us to upgrade the electric and expand Darlene's studio. Very good things as a specific recently imprisoned person might say.</p>

		<h2>10.06.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>In French, Chat. Chapeau.</h3>
	
	<p>I was in the back hall waiting for my cue. The sounds from the library auditorium echoed of sqeals and laughter. If it wasn't so happy sounding, I'd wonder if a riot was taking place.</p>

<p>"Lord, help me out here." I beseeched as I wondered what I got myself into. I had volunteered to be the Cat in the Hat for a Cat in the Hat Party.</p>

<p>I had taken photos of a Clifford party where "Clifford" interacted with 20 or so kids. I can deal with that. As the party date approached, I learned they had signed up 40 kids.</p>

<p>When I walked into the auditorium, there were no 40 kids there. The place was absolutely packed. "Hmmm, I'm supposed to read Cat in the Hat to this crowd?"</p>

<p>We played it just like the book. The librarian had to go get some craft materials so "the mom" wasn't home when the cat arrived. I came in promising fun. We did "The Cat Says" did a Conga line and a pair of Thing One and Thing Two dolls "body surfed" through the crowd.</p>

<p>I was out of things to do when I was finally rescued by the Librarian "coming home" and she asked me to read them the book.</p>

<p>I sat down among the crowd and used my loudest voice to read the story. For the most part they paid good attention. </p>

<p>From there the evening was a blur. I noticed things were a bit off kilter when a bunch of kids said they didn't get the craft project. Didn't get one??? We punted and gave away the gifts and cookies. Hey they even gave me a yo-yo too!</p>

<p>Afterwards as we were cleaning up, I had kids hug me, a couple Japanese kids danced the cat dance with me and had my picture taken with kids which was fun. I got down on my knees as this 7-foot-tall cat would tower over the 4-foot-tall kids.</p>

<p>Then I heard the kicker. One of our volunteers did a count as they were hearing a story. We had 76 kids show up for the party and that didn't include the umpteen toddlers who came with their parents (or the parents themselves). We had well over 100 folks in the auditorium.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, I'm not sure I would have done it if I knew I'd be the Cat for more than 100 as opposed to my assumed 20. But it worked and I had a lot of fun. What can I say, I am enough of a ham to pull it off.</p>

<p>I've always been a character. Now I know I can be a character.</p>

		<h2>10.01.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Finally... a day off</h3>
	
	<p>It seems like it's been weeks since we've had a day off. </p>

<p>I worked a week, studied while Darlene got ready for Chautauqua, I worked a week, I took the GRE, Darlene got ready for Chautauqua, I worked a week and then we spend the weekend in the sun doing the Chautauqua, then I worked a week.</p>

<p>Thank the good Lord that tomorrow is a day off!</p>

<p>Mind you, it'll be running errands and opening the studio. I'm doing all the catch up stuff that I've missed because of the GRE and Chautauqua. For example, I have three websites to update and I promised a new one for a consulting firm my friend works at.</p>

<p>Oh well, could be worse. I could still have to study for the GRE. (I'm still waiting for my essay scores....grrrrr).</p>

<p><br />
Meanwhile, Chautauqua went fine. Comparing Chautauqua sales this year to last year, we were down $400. Yet, for the first time ever, we had sales the week leading up to Chautauqua-- good sales. It seems a number of people were rushing to buy stuff before it found its way down to the show-- a local's sneak preview sale if you will. I won't argue. Combine that in and we are doing a lot better than last year. </p>
