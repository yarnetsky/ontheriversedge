	<p>James Doohan, the gentleman who brought Montgomery Scott alive on Star Trek died this morning. Scotty and Leonard "Bones" McCoy were my favorites. </p>

<p>I love that he never got sick of the "phrase": </p>

<blockquote>In a 1998 interview, Doohan was asked if he ever got tired of hearing the line ''Beam me up, Scotty.''

<p>''I'm not tired of it at all,'' he replied. ''Good gracious, it's been said to me for just about 31 years. It's been said to me at 70 miles an hour across four lanes on the freeway. I hear it from just about everybody. It's been fun.''</blockquote></p>

	<h3>It darn well took them long enough...</h3>
	
	<blockquote>C reported on his recent talks in Washington. There was a perceptible shift in attitude. Military action was now seen as inevitable. Bush wanted to remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy. The NSC had no patience with the UN route, and no enthusiasm for publishing material on the Iraqi regime's record. There was little discussion in Washington of the aftermath after military action.</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1593607,00.html">--From the secret Downing St. memo. 23 July 2002</a></p>

<p>Since the runup to Iraq War there were complaints about the intelligence being cherry picked to pave the way toward war.</p>

<p>Casual indications said they were right. The Niger yellowcake story fell apart. The former treasury secretary reporting that Bushies were planning war against Iraq within weeks of Inauguration. U.S. government confirmation that there were no weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<p>Finally, on 1 May 2005 The Times of London dropped  a bombshell in the form of a secret British memo (linked above) by a foreign Blair foreign policy aide. </p>

<p>The memo, minutes from a high-level British policy meeting, stated that evidence for war was being fixed.  Amazing isn't it? </p>

<p>The story was huge internationally, but until today it seemed only the Knight-Ridder papers had picked up on the story.</p>

<p>Today, in response to 89 Democratic house members demanding an explanation did CNN <a title="CNN.com - Bush asked to explain UK war memo - May 11, 2005" href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/05/11/britain.war.memo/index.html">finally cover the story</a>-- 10 days later. Indeed, the Democratic letter was released on May 6.</p>

<p>WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE THEY SITTING ON THEIR HANDS FOR? The corporate conservative media is at it again.</p>

<p>What amazes me was that not only did the memo nail the fixing of intelligence, but the fact we were telling the British war was inevitable before Bush told the American people that it wasn't.</p>

<p>It's not enough to impeach Bush, but it certainly is enough for me to lay the blood of tens of thousands at his feet. I'm sick of the lies and I'm sick of a media that won't ask questions.</p>

	<p>Interesting stuff coming out of Washington -- hearings over steroids in baseball and emergency legislation specifically for the parents of Terry Sorvino. </p>

<p>What are we not hearing about? Corruption in government (Tom Delay and taxpayer financed propaganda), Social Security, Medicare, the war in Iraq (yes Virginia... there's still a war going on), oil drilling in a national wildlife refuge, a federal budget that fluffs the furr of fatcats and a gawdawful bankrupcy bill.</p>

	<p>Having read snippets of this article, I'll read more later, I am not amazed, but truly astounded that the Bush administration wants to roll back regulations on mercury levels. This is some of the most toxic stuff out there!</p>

<blockquote>Letï¿½s start with a straightforward fact: Mercury is unimaginably toxic and dangerous. A single drop on a human hand can be irreversibly fatal. A single drop in a large lake can make all the fish in it unsafe to eat.</blockquote>

	<h3>Statistical liars</h3>
	
	<p>My view of the Social Security debate is whether or not we want the United States to be what the administration calls an "ownership society."</p>

<p>Based on the proposals I'm hearing, such as the elimination of employer paid health insurance, it'd be more of an "on your own" society where only the rich would have access to any kind of decent health care or retirement. (For the average American, the so-called medical saving accounts they outline would be wiped out by a single hospital stay).</p>

<p>Either way, Paul Krugman in his recent column points out that the administration, in effort to prove its point, is having a little too much fun with the Social Security numbers. </p>

<p>In essence if we take the assumptions used that the stock market would give great returns for retirement and used the same numbers to Social Security, than SS would be just fine.</p>

		<h2>01.29.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Election Eve</h3>
	
	<p>[<b>blogger's note</b>: Here's Darlene's take on the night before Iraq's so-called election.]</p>

<p>I have heard a lot of awful news coming out of Iraq lately.  The story of the station wagon with an entire family inside who for some reason (perhaps didn't hear the soldiers shout) didn't stop immediately at a checkpoint and the parents in the front seat were killed. Don't know if any of you saw the photo of the young girl covered in her parents' blood.  A horrible thing, war.  This is a very real result of it.  I have read estimates that up to 100,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed since this began.  The destruction of cities is rampant as well. Even in Bagdad they do not yet have reliable electricity and water.</p>

<p>Tomorrow the Iraqis are to vote in elections.  Our president says he anticipates "a grand moment in Iraqi's history."  But the situation is hardly ideal.  Insurgents have been blowing up polling places, election workers are being killed, and the populace is faced with the choice of risking their lives to cast a ballot.  (often being threatened to be killed if they do and if they do not go to the polls) And many Iraqis see themselves as living in an occupied country.  </p>

<p>I am fearful of what may occur tomorrow to the Iraqi citizens, to our soldiers, and to the innocent children who are so often caught in the crossfire.  Our president has been urging the Iraqis to vote.  I feel he is so bent on making a name for himself in history that he has put himself and his agenda above the safety of the countless soldiers and citizens in danger.  Make no mistake, Iraq is a war zone, and many sections of Iraq are NOT in control of the soldier or the interim Iraqi government. [<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/27/international/middleeast/27baghdad.html?pagewanted=all&position=">Across Bagdad, Security is Only an Ideal</a>] This was easily shown by the bombing of the American embassy today. While free elections sounds like a wonderful goal, it is unconscionable to risk the lives of so many in a country where so many other basic needs are left unmet.</p>

<p>May we all pray that tomorrow is not a nightmare as those polling places open.  The U.S. has enough blood on it's hands.</p>

	<h3>Tsunami video</h3>
	
	<p>Maybe everyone has seen video footage of the Indian Ocean Tsunami already. Not watching television, I have not. Today Darlene and I discovered several links to see footage. The videos are all in the 10-15 mb range.</p>

<p>Here's footage stored at <a href="http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=tsunami">Archive.org</a> and <a href="http://www.waveofdestruction.org/videos/">Wave of Destruction</a>.</p>

<p>Two videos seem to really deliver it home. </p>

<p>The first is from <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=index2&cid=968">AP video via Yahoo News</a> of the water rushing through the streets of an Indonesian city. Whole minivans being pushed down the street. (catch this link quickly, it may not last).</p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.archive.org/movies/details-db.php?collection=opensource_movies&collectionid=tsunami_phuket">amateur video</a> is in Phuket where the tsunami is coming in for a second wave. </p>

<p>The man holding the video camera follows it as it washes over the resort area and literally into the restaurant he is standing in. You river of water rushing by through the restaurant, his words saying it all. "Shit... shit... shit..." I admit I wouldn't be able to think of much more to say either. </p>

<p>Keep an eye on the corner of the screen where two men hold on for dear life to a fence, but are washed away. Unfortunately, the camera moves and we don't see what happens.</p>

	<h3>Ice glazed family</h3>
	
	<p><i>[<b>Note</b>: Darlene's family in the Lima, Ohio, area was hit with an ice storm. She got a call into her family. It's pretty bad up there, but I think I'd take this over a tsunami. The notion that 400,000 could be dead-- I can't comprehend. Either way, Darlene's report...]</i></p>

<p>Just heard from family up in Northwest Ohio.  We have been fussing here about the endless rain, but they got the ice storm last night.  At least 20,000 without power as of this morning.  Trees down, poles down, wires in the road.  Two counties up there have closed the roads completely.  Some of the branches my brother Stan saw had at least 2 inches of ice on them. My sister Sharon is out in the country.  Poles along her road for a mile or so are all down.  Was told it would be at least 3 days to restore power.  (Luckily my father has a generator and they were able to hook it up for her)  Sister Janie called me last night at about 10.  They moved last spring into the country outside of Bluffton, north of Lima, and trees surround their house.  They said their yard was full of big limbs and the crashing was continual.  Haven't heard from her today.</p>

<p>Both my brother Stan and my sister Rosalie said Lima looks like a war zone due to all the trees and poles down.  Stan drove across Lima last night and said up to 8 blocks in a row would be completely dark and that he kept having to detour around because so many city streets were blocked. Trees that are not down are losing limbs or bending wildly.  </p>

<p>Family friend who lives next to a woods says the crashing sounds kept him up all night.  When my brother went over this morning they could still hear endless crashing sounds in the woods.</p>

<p>So I guess I will take the rain, although the Ohio river is rising very fast!</p>

	<h3>When a cartoonist dies</h3>
	
	<p>Whenever a cartoonist dies, the world loses a bit of humor, artistry and adventure. </p>

<p><b>Charles Schulz'</b> death a few years back was heart breaking. More than any other cartoonist, he had my admiration. He single handedly drew the same comic strip for nearly 50 years, never taking a vacation, never using a ghost artist. Even when he hands shook from illness, he kept at it. </p>

<p>While the quality of the writing admittedly dropped in the later years, Peanuts is easily the best cartoon ever drawn. The work in the 60s, 70s and early 80s was heartfelt, thoughtful and even whimsical. There are other stars, but Schulz was the best.</p>

<p><b>Will Eisner,</b> however, was in his league and his death on Monday is a huge loss to the cartooning world.</p>

<p>Eisner is not a household name, but he is considered the "<a href="http://www.dccomics.com/news/article_display.html?nw_dc_itemCode=willeisner2005">father of graphic novels</a>."</p>

<p>My favorite work is "The Spirit." Eisner created mini-comics books every week which were inserted into Sunday newspapers for years in the 1940s. The protagonist Denny Colt was a detective who was "killed on duty." Actually he was in suspended animation and woke up buried in the Wildwood Cemetery. He decided to use his "death" to gain anonymity in order to continue hunting the bad guys as "The Spirit."</p>

<p>The storylines were everything from suspenseful to slyly humorous. The artwork, even considering it was printed on cheap newsprint, was awesome. The art started out simple, but as the series continued Eisner experimented with both style and content. Reading his work today you can easily see that nearly ever comic book and graphic novel artist has stolen some element from "the Spirit." </p>

<p>Here are a couple links<br />
<a href="http://www.willeisner.com">Will Eisner.com</a><br />
<a href="http://http://www.angelfire.com/art/wildwood/">Wildwood Cemetery: The Spirit Database</a><br />
<a href="http://www.willeisner.com">DC Comics: The Spirit Archives</a>. I highly recommend reading any of these volumes. <br />
<a href="http://www.dccomics.com/features/we_spirit/ecomic.html">A sample Spirit</a> e-comic reprint from 1946.</p>

<p>One side note: As much as I love the Spirit, one thing bothers me about the series. I find the Spirit's "black sidekick" Ebony White disturbing. I once attended a seminar detailing how African-Americans have been portrayed in pop culture over the past 150 years. The history is distrubing at best and absolutely disgusting at worst. Until then I had not realized the meanness, and indeed sheer evil intent, that a drawing can convey. Thus I find Ebony White, as "normal" as he may have seemed in the 1940s, disturbing.</p>

	<h3>Mind boggling</h3>
	
	<p>The last I checked, more than 80,000 people have died as result of the earthquake-tsunami. All I can do is to stare with my eyes wide open. Absolutely mind-boggling. The only thing I can think of to top this in sheer destruction is the toll of war.</p>

<p>I like that online businesses are offering their homepages to urge customers to give. <a href="http://s1.amazon.com/exec/varzea/ts/my-pay-page/PX3BEL97U9A4I/102-6097378-6148136">Amazon</a> has a direct way of contributing to the Red Cross (more than $3 million already). <a href="http:///www.apple.com">Apple</a> gave it's entire front page to promote giving. Google has a <a href="http://www.google.com/tsunami_relief.html">link</a> on it's homepage for links to give. You see this and go to a regular website and it almost seems callus.</p>

<p>I'm glad we upped our initial grant to the project from $15 to $35 million. I'd rather spend our tax dollars on this than some outrageously expensive spy satellite system that only works on clear days or on missle defense. </p>

<p>Mind you, I do think Bush is missing a huge opportunity. The area of Indonesia that is hardest hit is overwhelmingly Muslim. We could easily prove that we are not on a crusade here. However, to do that Bush needs to be in the forefront on this. Instead, he quietly sat in Crawford. In the long run I'm sure Bush will do right by the Indian Ocean community. He better.</p>

<p>[Update: Bush apparently was rather defensive in a press conference today about everything the US does for the relief effort. He should be, he should have opened his mouth immediately. But, hey, we are helping. That is good.]</p>

	<h3>Science Saturday: Wisdom of the Masses</h3>
	
	<p>How many jelly beans are in that jar? To get a decent answer short of counting them, ask dozens of people individually and average the answers. You'll get darn close.</p>

<p>That's the jist of an <a title="Scientific American.com: Common Sense -- Surprising new research shows that crowds are often smarter than individuals" href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&colID=13&articleID=00049F3E-91E1-119B-8EA483414B7FFE9F">article</a> from the Scientific American about how new research shows crowds can more accurately figure things out than individuals. </p>

<p>However, according to the research, "for a group to be smart, it should be autonomous, decentralized and diverse." Basically, you've got to avoid mob rule.</p>

<p>I heard some of the examples before, but it got me to thinking about our democracy. </p>

<p>Right now so much of the information we receive is filtered through a rapidly consolidating media. Indeed, the GOP has mastered the echo chamber.</p>

<p>However, what if people received their information individually from a primary source and then acted on that information. Could this result in a better nation? </p>

<p>For example, what if every voter in the country individually went through all the raw intelligence on Iraq and voted on whether to go to war based on that intelligence, would we have done so?</p>

	<p>Today is the first day of Darlene's holiday open house. It was quiet most of the day, but we've had a few people in and sold a couple things. Maybe not enough pieces to say it was worth being open for nine hours, but hey, I think a few people will be back.</p>

<p>On the table in the middle of our display is a bowl of chocolates-- mini-Snickers, dark chocolate Hershey Kisses and mini-York Peppermint Patties. It's a pretty darn good combo really.</p>

<p>It reminded me of a trio of health articles I've read on the BBC website this week about the elixir of life.</p>

<p>First up, according to a recent study, chocolate has an ingredient, theobromine, that is a third more effective at stopping persistant <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4032585.stm">coughs</a> than codeine with fewer side effects and no drowsiness.</p>

<p>Second at bat, a study from earlier this year finds that moms who <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3604275.stm">eat chocolate while pregnant</a> will have happier, livelier babies. </p>

<p>Finally, researchers are reporting this summer that dark chocolate has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3185363.stm">better anti-oxidant properties</a> than milk chocolate and thus is healthier. "Previous studies have suggested that chocolate may help to protect against heart disease and even cancer," the article stated.</p>

<p>Mind you, you still would have to deal with the high saturated fats and sugars. Oh well. I still don't think that'll stop me from having another one of those Kisses.</p>

	<h3>Help our soldiers</h3>
	
	<p>It's Veterans Day and a day to make a difference!</p>

<p>Apparently our wounded soldiers at Walter Reed Medical Hospital do not have paid long distance phone calls.  Thus the most needed item right now is phone cards so that our soldiers can call family and friends.  </p>

		<h2>10.28.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>A play on numbers</h3>
	
	<p>Darlene just pointed something out that I had been noticing lately.</p>

<p>An Associated Press article in the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-10-28-campaign-rdp_x.htm">USA Today</a> stated:</p>

<blockquote>Five days before Election Day, the polls were close and the crowds huge. Looking out at 10,000 faces at a Bush rally, failed GOP presidential candidate Bob Dole quipped, "I couldn't get a crowd like this in 1996."   .....   Pop culture merged with politics as rocker Bruce Springsteen endorsed Kerry and sang at the Massachusetts senator's rally in Madison, Wis., that drew thousands.</blockquote>

<p>They'll give numbers for Bush and not Kerry? So... how many showed up in Madison?</p>

<p><img alt="capt.sge.bav35.281004194301.photo01.photo.default-273x373.jpg" src="http://www.ontheriversedge.comhttps://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/images/capt.sge.bav35.281004194301.photo01.photo.default-273x373.jpg" width="273" height="373" border="0" /></p>

<p><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/041028/photos_ts_afp/041028194311_m9znkxio_photo1">AFP Photo from Yahoo.com</a></p>

<p><br />
<blockquote>Madison Assistant Fire Chief Carl Saxe told <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=1506&ncid=696&e=4&u=/afp/20041028/ts_alt_afp/us_vote_kerry">AFP</a> that at least 80,000 people were in the main crowd, while, at least 20,000 more were trying to get in on sidestreets, making the rally the biggest event in Madison's history.</blockquote></p>

<p>Hmmm... would you call this "thousands?"</p>

<p>We've been noticing the same thing with polls as well. If Bush is up by a point they write something to the effect of Bush surges ahead. When Kerry is up by 3, they write "candidates in a dead heat."</p>

<p>Amazing...</p>

	<h3>A nice coincidence</h3>
	
	<p>During a lunar eclipse, the Boston Red Sox finally break the Curse during the 100th World Series. Nice. Very nice.</p>

<p>Headline from <a title="Boston.com" href="http://www.boston.com/">The Boston Globe</a> right after the game: "AT LAST! Pigs can fly, hell is frozen, the slipper finally fits, and Impossible Dreams really can come true. The Red Sox have won the World Series"</p>

<p>Our favorite comment in a baseball thread at dailykos.com: "Who's still here? That was the rapture wasn't it?"</p>

<p>I wonder if John Kerry will have a little extra bounce to his step tomorrow.</p>

	<h3>Speaking of a lack of a plan...</h3>
	
	<p><i><b>Editor's note</b>: I've been trying to get Darlene to blog with me for a while now. So finally, this is her first entry. I have no idea if she'll ever contribute another, but I'll take what I can get.</i></p>

<p><br />
I would say this tidbit dovetails well with what Fahrenheit 911 implied was the White House's real reason for going to war in Iraq- it certainly clarifies where their priorities were in the aftermath.</p>

<p>Here is Bush's press secretary McClellan from today's White House press briefing answering questions about the recently revealed 380 tons of missing explosives in Iraq since the war began:</p>

<blockquote>Q But after Iraqi Freedom, there were those caches all around, wasn't the multinational force -- who was responsible for keeping track --

<p> MR. McCLELLAN: At the end of Operation Iraqi Freedom there were a number of priorities. It was a priority to make sure that the oil fields were secure, so that there wasn't massive destruction of the oil fields, which we thought would occur. It was a priority to get the reconstruction office up and running. It was a priority to secure the various ministries, so that we could get those ministries working on their priorities, whether it was -</p>

<p> Q So it was the multinational force's responsibility --</p>

<p> MR. McCLELLAN: There were a number of -- well, the coalition forces, there were a number of priorities at the end of Operation Iraqi Freedom.</blockquote></p>

<p>So there it is.  The priorities of the White House were securing oil fields and getting the reconstruction started.  Never mind that it only took less than one pound of this type of explosive to blow up the Lockerbie plane.</p>

<p>The quotes from the meeting were posted on <a href="http://www.dailykos.com">dailykos.com</a> this morning.  I followed the link to read more of the discussion.  Plenty of stonewalling.  A comment that there many munitions that were secured (true, but 380 tons missing can do an endless amount of damage)  What this boils down to was that there were not enough troops available to secure the country.  Period.</p>

<p>Looking forward to voting Bush out of office in 8 days,<br />
Darlene</p>

	<h3>There's Joy in Mudville</h3>
	
	<p>If this game and this series doesn't tell the Yankees "go to hell," I'm not sure what does. What an astounding series.</p>

<p><a title="ESPN.com - MLB/PLAYOFFS2004 - Caple: Cheers!" href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs2004/columns/story?columnist=caple_jim&id=1906307">Jim Caple of ESPN said it well:</a></p>

<blockquote>This winter, even if they lose the World Series, Boston fans can take solace in the sweet knowledge that their team somehow pulled off something truly historic, something unprecedented. In the previous 100 postseasons, no team had ever fallen behind 3-0 in a series and rallied to force a seventh game, let alone win it. The Red Sox not only did both, they crushed the Yankees, beating them with a pitcher who required sutures in his ankle in Game 6 and then routing them in a finale that was never close.</blockquote>

<p>I like the parallels I'm seeing here. The Republican Convention was in New York and the Democratic Convention was in Boston.... </p>

<p>Hey, a guy can dream can't he?</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Here's a great quote from the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/21/sports/21yankees.html?hp">New York Times</a>:</p>

<blockquote>It was actually happening. The nerd was kissing the homecoming queen. Paper was beating scissors; scissors were beating rock. Charlie Brown was kicking the football. The Red Sox were beating the Yankees for the American League pennant.</blockquote>

	<h3>Oh please, oh please, oh please</h3>
	
	<p>The Boston Red Sox are up 6-0 in the top of the second. Oh please win. This would be the sweetest league championship in history. To be down 3-0 and tie it up is astounding, but to win it in seven. Oh my... Then to have it be the Red Sox, even sweeter.</p>

<p>For starters, I absolutely can't stand the New York Yankees, they always beat my favorite team, the Kansas City Royals. But more than being an "Anybody But the Yankees," fan I root for Boston because a good chunk of my blood is from the area. My dad grew up across the river in Chelsea and much of his family is still in the Boston area. He was a Splendid Splinter fan in his youth. I'm rooting for the Sox.</p>

<p>This would rank higher for me than the Royals coming back from deficits to beat the BlueJays and Cardinals in 1985. This would rank as the biggest self-destruction of a giant in baseball history. Oh please....</p>

<p>A two-run homer in the first and a grand slam (from a former KC Royal) in the second... Oh please...</p>

	<h3>I can't believe we're not signing</h3>
	
	<p><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=519&ncid=519&e=23&u=/ap/20041014/ap_on_re_us/un_population_agenda">Oh Good Grief...</a></p>

<blockquote>The United States has refused to join 85 other heads of state and governments in signing a statement that endorsed a 10-year-old U.N. plan to ensure every woman's right to education, health care, and choice about having children.

<p>President Bush's administration withheld its signature because the statement included a reference to "sexual rights."</p>

<p>U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kelly Ryan wrote to organizers of the statement that that the United States was committed to the Cairo plan of 1994 and "to the empowerment of women and the need to promote women's fullest enjoyment of universal human rights."</p>

<p>"The United States is unable, however, to endorse the world leaders' statement," Ryan said, because it "includes the concept of `sexual rights,' a term that has no agreed definition in the international community."</p>

<p>Ryan did not elaborate on the Bush administration's objections to the phrase "sexual rights," but at past U.N. meetings U.S. representatives have spoken out against abortion, gay rights and what they see as the promotion of promiscuity by giving condoms to young people to prevent AIDS.</blockquote></p>

<p>First, the idea that we preach freedom then refuse to sign this agreement is a farce. </p>

<p>The condom argument is the worst.  Condoms are extraordinarily important, especially in the third world and Africa. To hold up their distribution based on conservative views of procreation is narrow minded at best and tragic to the world's population at worst.</p>

<p>Condoms are not perfect, but for the price they are darn good at providing basic birth control and basic protection against sexually transmitted diseases.</p>

<p>Both are extraordinarily important issues in a region of the world that is experiencing hell due to a combination of over-population, poverty and an AIDS epidemic that is spreading like wildfire. Toss in a frequently occuring famine and a genocide or two and you get the idea.</p>

<p>Now is a time for stemming the epidemic and condoms can cetainly help. This is one instance where an ounce of prevention is worth more than a pound of cure. A one-ounce condom is certainly a lot better than trying to figure out how to pay for a boat load of AIDS medications.</p>

<p>Then, once things have settled down, people will be more willing to listen to some preaching about "the santity of life." But until people stop dying by the boat-load, it won't make much sense.</p>

		<h2>09.10.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Here come the guns again</h3>
	
	<p>When my father died, he was a police officer at Miami University. For the most part it was a peaceful job, but I do remember one of his cohorts being faced with a drug-crazed college student weilding a switch-blade. It could have been a lot worse.</p>

<p>With the ban on semi-automatic weapons set to expire on Monday, it is easy to imagine worse.</p>

<p>Obviously, my father owned guns and regularly practiced their use. A few times he had taken me to the shooting range. I've shot a few rounds, but it didn't really interest me. </p>

<p>My dad said the key to guns is respect and safety. You respect their power, you keep them locked up when not in use. With that in mind, I don't have a problem with gun ownership. If we ever get our building to a state of non-chaos, I could finally display an antique flintlock my father gave me.<br />
 <br />
But even with the respect for gun ownership, I still have no idea what use a semi-automatic weapon would be to anyone.</p>

<p>What do AK-47s have to do with hunting? <br />
Why do gun makers advertise their arms as <a href="http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/shooting/0424guns9.shtml">"fingerprint proof"</a>?</p>

<p>I think Kerry said it aptly <a title="The New York Times > Kerry Says Bush Assault Weapons Stance Aids Terrorists" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/10/politics/campaign/10CND-CAMP.html?hp"> today</a>...<br />
<blockquote>"Four years ago," Mr. Kerry said in St. Louis, "George Bush said he'd stand with and protect America's police officers by extending the assault-weapons ban, which keeps the most dangerous assault weapons off our streets, the same weapons that America's police officers want off our streets, not just to fight ordinary crime but to take on terrorists.</p>

<p>"In fact," the Democratic presidential candidate went on, "an Al Qaeda training manual recovered in Afghanistan included a chapter urging terrorists to get assault weapons in the United States. Why is George Bush making the job of the terrorists easier and making the job for America's police officers harder?"</blockquote></p>

<p>Yes, a terrorist can use of about anything as a weapon-- Timothy McVeigh proved that. Yet why should we make access to these weapons easy? Who benefits? I just don't get it.</p>

	<h3>Buffalo: Anniversary of Wm. McKinley being shot</h3>
	
	<p>I was amazed when skimming the NYTimes that today was the anniversary of President William McKinley getting shot at the 1901 Pan American Exposition in Buffalo, NY. </p>

<p>My hometown was one of the richest and largest cities in the country and the Expo was Buffalo's coming out party-- flush with electricity that came from Niagara Falls. </p>

<p>It was a gorgous expo with Spanish influenced architecture surrounding a lake in a Olmstead designed park. Unfortunately, the buildings were built of wood lathe and plaster and they are gone. Only one expo building, the New York State Building, was designed as a keeper which is now the <a href="http://www.bechs.org/">Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society.</a></p>

<p>McKinley was speaking at the expo when an anarchist shot him. It's believed that he would have lived had the doctors not botched the surgery. Here's the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0906.html?dpc">9-6-1901 front page</a> from the New York Times.</p>

<p>Here are some good links about the expo:</p>

<p>Here are some Edison <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/papr/mckhome.html">motion pictures from the expo.</a> Neat Stuff! Especially the <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?papr:16:./temp/~ammem_9hNW::">Electric Tower</a> film taken from a hot air balloon. The water fall fountain at the base of the building is awesome.</p>

	<h3>Twilight zone quality</h3>
	
	<p>Interesting week to say the least...</p>

<p>In the outside world::</p>

<p>Poor Paul Hamm is still suffering at the hands of the FIG (don't give up the gold).</p>

<p>Bush says we can't win the war on terrorism (then "flip-flops" like a fish out of water trying to explain it all).</p>

<p>I feel bad for whomever wrote the speech the Bush girls gave as they'll be living out the rest of the year in the gulag.</p>

<p>In our life::</p>

<p>I spoke before a plan commission meeting where I'm quoted as saying the word <a href="http://www.madisoncourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=4&SubSectionID=263&ArticleID=19852">"holistically" </a> before the board. I don't remember it. Though I admit I don't remember much of what I did say-- it's amazing how you quickly one can become a deer in the headlights. </p>

<p>Today, our assistant director and I attended a grant writing workshop where we were supposed to have come prepared to start working on writing a grant. There was only one problem... no one told us. It was supposed to be in the confirmation letter, but it was not. Fortunately (and unfortunately) I have 30 days to come up with a grant idea and write the proposal. I'll obviously be meeting with the director in the morning. We couldn't pull one out of the air that didn't fit our plans and I already have a grant I'm trying to administer (as well as the 2005-2007 technology plan I'm working on).</p>

<p>Darlene meanwhile has pots all over the place in the studio. Literally on every exposed surface. It's a lot of fun to watch (especially as the shelves are getting bare and we have a show coming up).</p>

<p>That's life on the river's edge.</p>

	<p>The British website Spiked has an article about the Precautionary Principal that is rather interesting. Basically we're <a title="spiked-risk | Article | More sorry than safe" href="http://www.spiked-online.com/Articles/0000000CA592.htm">more sorry than safe</a> is we constantly hedge from taking incremental risks to stay safe:</p>

<blockquote>Berry points to the restrictions imposed on DDT - the pesticide used to get rid of malaria-carrying mosquitoes - as another example of how the 'application of precaution' can cause death and disease. In some third world countries where malaria had been all but eradicated over the past 20 years, there have been epidemics of the disease since DDT was restricted. Currently malaria is on the rise in all the tropical regions of the planet; in 2000, it killed more than one million and made 300million seriously ill. 'Campaigners claimed that DDT was bad for the environment; they said that it caused harm to American birds of prey. I'm sorry, but why should people in the third world at risk from malaria care about American birds of prey? Decisions about these things should be based on local needs and on empirical evidence.'
</blockquote>

<p>I suspect anyone interested in the stem-cell research debate would find this an interesting article.<br />

	<h3>Talk about mind numbing disaster</h3>
	
	<p>Mother Nature sure can give us a whipping. Darlene and I have been looking at photos of the devistation from Hurricane Charley and we're numb.</p>

<p>We watched the path and initially feared it would hit our friends who own an inn at Cedar Key (SE of Gainesville well north of Tampa). But, boy did it take an unexpected turn. </p>

<p>I felt bad for one guy who said he felt foolish for spending a few hundred dollars to get out of town further up the coast and came south only to end up in the middle of the hurricane. It was that unexpected.</p>

<p>Our prayers are with y'all. Keep the faith and hang in there.</p>

<p>If you haven't already seen tons of photos in the paper or on television, <a title="The News-Press: Hurricane" href="http://www.news-press.com/news/weather/hurricane/index.html">The News-Press</a> out of Fort Myers has good coverage.</p>

	<h3>"36 Hours in Buffalo"</h3>
	
	<p>My hometown gets a kiss from The New York Times (same state 400 miles away) via it's travel column "36 Hours."</p>

<p><a title="The New York Times > Travel > Escapes > 36 Hours: Buffalo" href="http://travel2.nytimes.com/2004/08/13/travel/escapes/13HOUR.html?8hpib=&pagewanted=all&position=">36 Hours: Buffalo</a> features most my favorite places-- especially the Elmwood Street shopping district which is truly fun and funky.</p>

<p>Sitting here in Madison-- where summer days often hit the double 90s (90+ temps and 90+ humidity) -- I have often fantasized about Buffalo summers. It's nice to know, however, that my recollections are not just imagination.</p>

<blockquote>The time to visit is summer, when Buffalo gets a glorious payback for its snowy winters with some of the best weather in the nation ï¿½ three months of mostly sunny, dry days with temperatures in the high 70's and low 80's.</blockquote>

	<h3>A new "Bushism"</h3>
	
	<p>To welcome another Friday, I present President Bush's latest <a title="MSNBC - A new 'Bushism': We're gonna get us" href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/5613296/">fun quote</a>:<br />

	<h3>I'm jazzed. Hope truly is on the way</h3>
	
	<p>Just finished watching the Kerry speech on the net and I'm jazzed.</p>

<p>As far as sheer speech making goes, it didn't hold a candle to Barak Obama's awesome keynote address. But for John Kerry it was just perfect. (<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A25678-2004Jul29.html">read it</a>|<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/mmedia/politics/072904-27v.htm">watch it</a>)</p>

<p>I was impressed with how absolutely ingenious his entry to the speech was: "I'm John Kerry and I'm reporting for duty." </p>

<p>Right there everything that has been said in the prior days in the convention had been wrapped up in a single phrase. Right there, patriotism and the urge to serve is fulfilled.</p>

<p>The speech itself was surprising. Kerry, strongly defended about any weakness you could imagine the Democratic Party having. "Oh, they're a party of the '60s.'" Yes, Kerry said and through it we provided civil rights, voting rights, womens rights and we're back to finish the job. He always brought it back to the future and hope for the future.</p>

<p>And my did he slam the Bush adminstration. </p>

<blockquote>"I will be a commander in chief who will never mislead us into war. I will have a vice president who will not conduct secret meetings with polluters to rewrite our environmental laws. I will have a secretary of defense who will listen to the best advice of the military leaders.ï¿½ And I will appoint an attorney general who will uphold the Constitution of the United States."</blockquote>

<p>Amen. The opening has been played in the chess match. This will be interesting.</p>

	<h3>Bush's lucky day</h3>
	
	<p>While I suspect the Republicans are a tad terrified over Kerry picking the popular Edwards as his running mate, Bush actually royally lucked out. </p>

<p>Sean Aday of The Gadflyer writes about <a title="The Gadflyer: Bush's Good Press Day" href="http://gadflyer.com/articles/?ArticleID=160">Bush's Good Press Day</a>... as in what <b>didn't</b> get into the media distracted by Edwards:<br />
<blockquote>So let's review: Cheney lied to the American people and continues to do so; the Administration lied to Congress (and therefore the American people) and threatened an administrator with his job if he squealed; even Tony Blair can't keep lying about WMD; our "values" President thinks some Neanderthal who would probably be more comfortable in a Taliban courtroom than an American one deserves a lifetime appointment to the federal bench; and Iraq is still a unmitigated disaster.</blockquote><br />

	<h3>Bush endorses condoms?</h3>
	
	<p>Candidates say amazing things during an election year, but who would have guessed that George W. would mention the word <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/24/politics/campaign/24bush.html?pagewanted=all&position=">condoms</a>?</p>

<blockquote>"We can learn from the experiences of other countries when it comes to a good program to prevent the spread of AIDS, like the nation of Uganda," Mr. Bush said. "They've started what they call the A.B.C. approach to prevention of this deadly disease. That stands for: Abstain, be faithful in marriage, and, when appropriate, use condoms." The approach was working and was a "practical, balanced and moral message," Mr. Bush said.</blockquote>

<p>This may be the first time in a couple of years that I automatically agree with Bush. Yet, I'm still skeptical. </p>

<p>According to the New York Times article Bush has pledged $15 million over five year to the cause of fighting AIDS, yet the administration doesn't seem to as aggressive as that number would suggest. They're holding back on exporting cheaper generic drugs that could make a huge difference and while the number of condoms going overseas from the U.S. is topping 400 million, the number needed is closer to 10 billion.</p>

<p>Yet, the fact Bush said the "c-word" and acknoledged a scientific approach to any problem is pretty amazing, especially considering he was talking before a church group.</p>

<p>But for now I'll wait for action (and admittedly hope that it's Kerry implementing the program). </p>

<p>Abstanance and fidelity are the best ways to avoid STDs and AIDS. But when you're dealing with an epidemic millions of people and deaths in size, you need to immediately stem its spread, then we can worry about teaching the "moral" behavior (though there's no reason they can't be done simultaneously).</p>

<p>I think the reason I'm skeptical that "saying" condoms will result in a more progressive AIDS strategy is the administration is not using the same approach with respect to birth control. In Africa, we have a population boom in a region that cannot sustain the numbers, yet the conservatives don't want to fund birth control. They just want to preach. </p>

<p>So tell me. Why can't we do both? Why are we inviting disasters?</p>

	<h3>SpaceShipOne</h3>
	
	<p>After reading about politics for one too many days, today's news that SpaceShipOne succeeded in becoming the first non-governmental flight into space was wonderful. <a title="Wired News: Private Space Shot a Success" href="http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,63924,00.html">Wired News</a> has a good story on the event. It's obvious the pilot had way too much fun... <br />
</blockquote>"I did something that nobody was aware I was going to do," he said. "When I got to apogee ... I reached into my pocket and I took out some candy-covered chocolates, all different colors, and I let 'em go in front of my face. And they just spun around like sparkling things. And I was so blown away that I couldn't fly the airplane."</blockquote><br />
I remember having a membership or reservation card for PanAm's first trip to the moon. The card, which had a futuristic painting of a "space clipper", was one of my prized possessions. It's obvious PanAm didn't last long enough to fulfill it's reservation list, but it's nice to see private enterprise taking a step in the right direction.</p>

	<h3>Majority tyranny</h3>
	
	<p>Thinking about it more, I believe all groups should be politically active. That's the freedom we have. Organizations need to be able to flex the power of numbers.</p>

<p>I think what I fear is majority tyranny.</p>

<p>For example, the Republicans as the majority in the house have literally created and passed legislation without as much as a word from Democrats in the process.</p>

<p>Then, when the Democrats try to slow down the process to get their two cents into the dollar being created, the Republicans hollar that the Democrats are trying to subvert the majority will. This is amplified by the Republicans' mantra of treason everytime someone disagrees with them.</p>

<p>Frustrating, no?</p>

<p>Conservatives by definition want to keep things they way they were (or for the cynical, keep things the way they thought they were). Yet, for better or worse, our country is changing. It's multi-cultural and multi-religious and soon the "white man" will become a minority.</p>

<p>In this kind of setting, majority tyranny is simply not a "good thing."</p>

<p>What does this have to do with church-state separation? Basically, a poltical party can bring with it a specific brand of religion that in turn can impinge on the freedom of other practices.</p>

<p>As Thomas Jefferson wrote, "We hold these truths to be self evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."</p>

<p>It's hard to have the liberty to say your peace or to pursue one's version of happiness, beit worshipping Christ, Allah or money when one group has the handle on every control and drop-kicks anyone who wants to suggest the boat is capsizing.</p>

<p>To me this freedom needs to be spread around more than it is. Both to where Christians seeking power can exercise their beliefs in freedom and so those who don't have the same beliefs can have the same freedoms.</p>

<p>Schools need to be open to folks who practice their religion. Christian groups wants to meet after school on school property? So be it. Voluntary meetings around the flag pole for a prayer before school? Go for it. If a teacher wants to join in, fine.</p>

<p>The key is that their practices should not impinge on the freedom of others to do the same. Thus the same teacher at the pole before school should not be leading the prayer in homeroom.</p>

<p>It's not a matter of political correctness or "special rules" for minorities. Rather, it's following the spirit of that Declaration, of following the Golden Rule and simply respecting your fellow human beings. Everyone should be made comfortable and welcomed as who they are.</p>

<p>Thus, the majority can run the government, but they shouldn't "rule" the country. That went out with King George III.</p>

	<h3>Bishops to campaign for Bush?</h3>
	
	<p>Frequent church-goers more often vote Republican and there is no surprise that Bush is aiming to take advantage of this demographic.</p>

<p>However, I am amazed at the depth at which Bush and the Republicans are attempting to narrow the separation of church and state to tilt the equation in their favor.</p>

<p>Two articles of interest.</p>

<p>The Washington Post reports that the house Republicans inserted a rider in the latest fast-track "jobs" bill that would <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26244-2004Jun8.html">allow pastors more freedom to engage in political activism</a> without their churches losing their tax-exempt status.</p>

<p>The article also notes a Bush campaign email that the campaign is looking to identify 1,600 "friendly congregations" in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Penalties for code violations would also be dialed down with the first violation being only a week's worth of taxes. That's pretty cheap political advertising.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <i>National Catholic Reporter</i> Vatican correspondent John L. Allen Jr. <a href="http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/word/">wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>During his visit, Bush asked the Vatican to push the American Catholic bishops to be more aggressive politically on family and life issues.... A Vatican official told NCR June 9 that in his meeting with Cardinal Angelo Sodano and other Vatican officials, Bush said, ï¿½Not all  the American bishops are with meï¿½ on the cultural issues. The implication was that he hoped the Vatican would nudge them toward more explicit  activism.</blockquote>

<p>I have hard time believing that 44 years ago people were worried that the Vatican would run a Kennedy White House. Now we apparently have Bush asking the Vatican to help him run his campaign for the White House.</p>

<p>I hope to have more thoughts on this tomorrow...</p>

	<h3>Even cicadas like our library</h3>
	
	<p>I've heard people call Brood X an invasion. The cicadas are definitely in full force here in Madison and we are inundated with the red-eyed, vainy-winged bugs.</p>

<p>As the front door of our library opens, the buzz roars in and fades out as the door shuts once again.</p>

<p>That's been the scenario for the past 10 days. Today, however, I think the cicadas have finally realized what a cool library we have. They're riding their way in on the backs of our patrons.</p>

<p>This afternoon, a mom was checking out books as I was helping her daughter learn how to use Indiana's Virtual Library <a href="http://www.inspire.net">Inspire.net</a>. Suddenly, we heard a very loud chirping from across the reading room. The young woman's mother was jumping around clearly stunned. Soon, the poor woman realized there was a cicada in her purse. </p>

<p>Not three minutes later, I'm still helping the student find journal articles on viruses and an older gentleman walked in and started chirping as well. As he found one in his pocket, the two of us couldn't keep from laughing. He promptly dropped it on the floor and crunched it with his foot. Just what we needed, crushed cicada on our carpet.</p>

<p>An hour later, I was checking out some videos for a young man who suddenly grabbed at his neck and found a cicada crawling down the collar of his shirt. Even knowing he had it in his hand we both jumped when the thing started chirping. Those puppies are loud.</p>

<p>The buggers are falling from the trees, swarm at the lightest distraction and, unlike flies, know nothing of people, dogs, cars or anything else on earth for that matter. They're all over the sidewalks and streets, many dead having been stomped on or driven over. I had a couple "riding" on my bike. </p>

<p>They're even showing public displays of affection.  I now regularly see pairs of cicadas on top of each. I was suddenly glad not to have children at this immediate point. Not only would I have to explain the birds and the bees, but cicadas as well. </p>

<p>One of our patrons in this very boat said she was very happy when her kid readily settled for the answer of "they're mating." She's not sure if the child knew what the word meant, but was happy to not have to explain it.</p>

<p>While I'm glad we've visited by Brood X only once every 17 years, I'm enjoying the spectacle. </p>

<p>This morning I went to the Hanover College library to pick up some inter-library loan books that were mis-routed seven miles in the wrong direction. Hanover is a very leafy campus and it was evident from the holes in the ground that there were a few million bugs along with the 2,000 students. </p>

<p>The funny thing was the sound. There were so many of them that the overall aural feel of the cicada calls had changed. Instead of sounding like crickets on acid, the hum took on a whiring sound not unlike what you'd hear from space ships in 1950s sci-fi movies.</p>

<p>Hmmm, maybe we are being invaded.</p>

	<h3>'The course is headed over Niagara Falls'</h3>
	
	<p>One of the worst things about how we went to war in Iraq is how the administration largely ignored the pleas from the large majority of professionals on the ground.</p>

<p>Most generals and diplomats argued that over-throwing Iraq was the wrong war at the wrong time.</p>

<p>Instead, the neo-cons relied on information from slippery sorts such as Iraqi National Congress member Ahmed Chalabi, whom they are now realizing is one of the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/20/iraq/main618637.shtml">last people they should have listened to.</a> His info on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was at best questionable intelligence (at worst an outright lie) and he is now believed to be an Iranian spy to boot. Go figure.</p>

<p>While three of the four past generals in charge of the military's Central Command have gone on the record opposing the war, Retired General Anthony Zini, who was also Bush's first special envoy to the Middle East, is currently the most vocal.</p>

<p>In an interview with CBS News' 60 Minutes, Zini stated: ï¿½There has been poor strategic thinking in this. There has been poor operational planning and execution on the ground. And to think that we are going to ï¿½stay the course,ï¿½ the course is headed over Niagara Falls. I think it's time to change course a little bit, or at least hold somebody responsible for putting you on this course. Because it's been a failure.ï¿½</p>

<p>That's almost mild compared to what he has written in a just-released book about his career with Tom Clancy called "Battle Ready."</p>

<p>In the book Zini states: "In the lead up to the Iraq war and its later conduct, I saw at a minimum, true dereliction, negligence and irresponsibility, at worse, lying, incompetence and corruption." </p>

<p><a title="CBS News | Gen. Zinni: 'They've Screwed Up' | May 24, 2004Â 14:04:39" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/21/60minutes/main618896.shtml">Read more</a> of his thoughts from CBS News.</p>

	<h3>The answer is NATO</h3>
	
	<p>Remember back when the GOP was harassing Kerry about which leaders wanted him as president?</p>

<p>Well, I think we have found one answer-- <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/iraq/la-fg-troops9may09,1,5346761.story?coll=la-home-headlines">the leaders of NATO.</a></p>

<blockquote>The Western military alliance had expected to announce at a June summit that it would accept a role in the country, perhaps by leading the international division now patrolling south-central Iraq. But amid continuing bloodshed and strong public opposition to the occupation in many nations, allies want to delay any major commitment until after the U.S. presidential election in November, officials say.</blockquote>

	<h3>New work on Mudcat Pottery website and other thoughts</h3>
	
	<p>For the fun of it Darlene and I have been making tiles as a sideline to her regular Mudcat work. I posted several of the tiles on her <a href="http://mudcatpottery.ontheriversedge.com/kiln/">Hot from the Kiln</a> page of her website.</p>

<p>Three of the tiles I actually created-- "Maneki Neko," "Hoosier Cat" and "Broadway Fountain Fish" The rest Darlene did and I'll post more of her tiles soon.</p>

<p>There's also a new hand-built carved box and mini-jar that I love.</p>

<p>I added the new pots as we waiting out the rain today. This is the second weekend of our Grand Open House. This weekend's been slower than last weekend (though everyone may be down in Louisville for the Kentucky Derby). However, we had one gentleman who bought seven pieces for wedding gifts-- that's a nice sale.</p>

<p>Also interesting article about fear in this month's Utne magazine. In the sidebar "7 ways to rethink fear" here are a couple of tidbits.<br />
<blockquote><b>Old thoughts</b>: If I act on what I believe, conflict will break out. I'll be humiliated and ineffective. New Thoughts: Conflict means engagement. Something is in motion. It's an opening, not a closing.</b></blockquote><br />
Maybe that can be a mantra for John Kerry... and me as well.</p>

	<h3>A lack of scientific literacy</h3>
	
	<p>I found this fun nugget over at <a href="http://www.lisnews.com">LISNews.com</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently, the Aliso Viejo, Calif., city council was so worried about the dangerous properties of dihydrogen monoxide that they almost banned the substance. A hoax website used as the source for the council bill stated "the odorless, tasteless chemical is dangerous when accidentally inhaled."</p>

<p>Yes, it is dangerous when inhaled. But otherwise is pretty nice stuff. I might get  drink of it. I'm thirsty.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/local/states/california/the_valley/8185305.htm">San Jose Mercury News</a> has the story.</p>

	<h3>'Texas governor's race gets Kinky'</h3>
	
	<p>OK, I'm glad I read the newspaper. <br />
The <a title="HoustonChronicle.com - Texas governor's race gets Kinky" href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/metropolitan/2433090">Houston Chronicle</a> is reporting that author Kinky Friedman is planning to run for Texas governor as an independent in 2006.</p>

<blockquote>"There are no skeletons in my closet. They are all bleaching on a beach somewhere," he said.   

<p>You want to know Kinky's stand on gun control?  "I do not carry a gun myself, so if someone is going to shoot me, they better remember to bring their own weapon."   </p>

<p>On abortion?  "I am not pro-life, I am not pro-choice, I am pro football."</blockquote>   <br />
Do I have to wait until 2006? I could use some of this levity this year.</p>

	<h3>GOP calling the kettle black</h3>
	
	<p>I should stop reading the newspaper. It just gets my blood boiling. </p>

<p><a title="Two Blamed for Senate Computer Snooping" href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/national/AP-Judiciary-Memos.html">Two Republican Senate aides</a> are blamed for computer snooping and conservatives are blaming the Democrats.</p>

<p>The two aides snagged hundreds upon hundreds of confidential files from a Democratic computer server after one of them learned how to get in by watching a systems administrator.</p>

<p>The aides excuse? The files weren't protected well. If the guys watched an office worker punch in a door combination then used the same combo to walk in and get papers, it would be theft and B&E.</p>

<p>In the meantime, conservatives are calling for an investigation into the content of the stolen memos. They say the Demcrats "colluded" with liberal political groups to block conservative judicial nominees-- specifically conservative minority nominees.</p>

<p>Well, they can have their so-called "investigation." </p>

<p>While they're at it, maybe they can also find out:<br />
<li>Who <a href="http://www.prospect.org/webfeatures/2004/02/kuttner-r-02-26.html">Vice President Dick Chaney</a> "colluded" with when he created the administration's energy policy. <br />
<li>Why Chaney can still profit from Haliburton on stock options even as the company reams the military for millions upon millions.<br />
<li>Who outted Vicki Plame as a CIA operative and who knew of the smear campaign.<br />
<li>Why the National Security Council was discussing invading Iraq just days after walking into the Oval Office for the first time.</p>

<p>Leave it up to the GOP to call a kettle black when their own kettle is whistling with boiling water.</p>

	<h3>You gotta wonder about their priorities</h3>
	
	<p>The Bush administration was so busy setting up the Iraq war that they repeatedly refused to <a title="MSNBC - Avoiding attacking suspected terrorist mastermind" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4431601/">attack a suspected terrorist mastermind</a> even when there was an "airtight" case the Al Queda related cell was working on chemical weapons.</p>

<p>Abu Musab Zarqawi. a Jordanian militant, is now blamed for 700 deaths in Iraq and is still at large. We could have had him.</p>

<p>This is a perfect example of why I didn't favor the Iraq war. Bush & Co. were so busy with "their" war that they weren't fighting "our" war.</p>

	<h3>Civil Rights. Will it happen in our generation?</h3>
	
	<p>Gov. A.S. of California should consider himself lucky he's not facing the Junior State legislature. According to a <a title=" sacbee.com -- Politics -- Cold reception for gay wedding ban " href="http://www.sacbee.com/content/politics/story/8363005p-9292831c.html">Sacramento Bee</a> article, the Northern California Junior State convention overwhelmingly approved allowing gay marriage. This much to the chagrin of Republican State Senator Pete Knight who had hoped to convince them otherwise.</p>

<p>Knight is quoted as hoping the students' opinions will change as they get older. Polls, however, don't give him much hope. In a Field Poll, 58 percent of 18-26 year olds favor gay marriage compared to 26 percent of those over 65.</p>

<p>In my mind this is a good sign. This is a somewhat naive statement, but it seems each generation buries the boogiemen of the previous generation. Persecuted immigrant groups are accepted, taboos are legalized. I'm remembering that inter-racial marriage was illegal not that long ago.</p>

<p>For me it boils down to a human rights question. There is no excuse for any person being unable to designate another person to safe guard their rights, to talk on their behalf, to inherit their property upon death. If I'm in the hospital, I want my "other half" to be there to comfort me and to talk to doctors. </p>

<p>In my case, that's obviously Darlene. But what about Dick Chaney's daughter? Should she not have the same right?</p>

<p>I'm not sure what the answer is. It's probably somewhere in the middle as is the case with many issues. </p>

<p>Maybe it's time for the church alone to worry about "marriage." This way Protestants, Jews, Catholics, Orthodox, Hindus, Buddists and Muslims can all have total freedom in consecrating marriage in their own ways. Freedom of religion.</p>

<p>In turn, maybe the states could authorize "household corporations." Any human can enter into a household corporation with any other human for the purposes of common wealth and health. Maybe it wouldn't be limited to "couples." This way your two widowed aunts could take care of each in old age legally as well as spiritually.</p>

<p>Darlene and I? We were married by a pair of ministers and are very happy to have been blessed by God in our union. Nonetheless, maybe you can call us "Yarnetsky, Inc."</p>

<p>Any of this is obviously open to debate for years to come-- though I'm amazed at already hearing Bush allow for the possibility of civil unions--how the debate quickly shifts.</p>

<p>In the meantime, let's stop ignoring the education of millions of children and the jobs of a millions of employees and the welfare of our fine planet, which should bloom in our neck of the woods anytime now.</p>

	<h3>Addicted to Love</h3>
	
	<p>For those madly in love, I offer up this article from <a title="Economist.com" href="http://www.economist.com/printedition/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Story_ID=2424049">Economist.com</a>.<br />
<blockquote>In 2000, Andreas Bartels and Semir Zeki of University College, London, located the areas of the brain activated by romantic love. They took students who said they were madly in love, put them into a brain scanner, and looked at their patterns of brain activity.</p>

<p>The results were surprising. For a start, a relatively small area of the human brain is active in love, compared with that involved in, say, ordinary friendship. ï¿½It is fascinating to reflectï¿½, the pair conclude, ï¿½that the face that launched a thousand ships should have done so through such a limited expanse of cortex.ï¿½ The second surprise was that the brain areas active in love are different from the areas activated in other emotional states, such as fear and anger. Parts of the brain that are love-bitten include the one responsible for gut feelings, and the ones which generate the euphoria induced by drugs such as cocaine. So the brains of people deeply in love do not look like those of people experiencing strong emotions, but instead like those of people snorting coke. Love, in other words, uses the neural mechanisms that are activated during the process of addiction. ï¿½We are literally addicted to love,ï¿½ Dr Young observes.</blockquote><br />
No wonder breaking up is so horrible. You suffer withdrawl.</p>

	<h3>When Opportunity knocks</h3>
	
	<p>It sure is fun to find the NASA scientists with the jaws on the ground.</p>

<p>The second Mars rover "Opportunity" couldn't have landed in a more interesting spot on Mars. Smack dab in a crater with a layer dusty grey hematite covering Martian bedrock. What caused the stuff? Volcanos? Water? Awesome stuff.</p>

<p>Seeing the first photo of the deep red stuff, Darlene, spoken like a true potter, couldn't resist wanting some to glaze her pots with.</p>

<p>I loved the quote from Dr. Squyres in today's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/26/science/space/26MARS.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1075129689-vB7OPWBIAkS2qzshiUuA8A">NY Times</a>. </p>

<blockquote>To Dr. Steven W. Squyres, the dark, surreal landscape encircling the Mars rover Opportunity resembled only one other place.

<p> "This is exactly what it looked like in my wildest dreams," said Dr. Squyres, a professor of astronomy at Cornell University who is principal investigator for the two NASA rovers currently on Mars..... </p>

<p>Dr. Squyres said he had expected Opportunity, at best, to land close enough to reach a crater. "Instead, what has happened is that we have scored a 300-million-mile interplanetary hole in one," he said Sunday afternoon. Opportunity, he said, appears to be inside a shallow  crater about 20 yards wide and a couple of yards deep.</blockquote></p>

<p>With a shot like that their handicap should go down quite a bit.</p>

	<h3>Possum update</h3>
	
	<p>It turned out that the article in the New York Times caught the attentions of the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. They threatened a lawsuit so the owner of the Brasstown gas station used roadkill instead of a live possum. They had to search all over to find one, but found a half decent one which fell at midnight. They didn't have to be nice to that one.</p>

	<h3>New Years Eve possum</h3>
	
	<p>New York drops the ball, but Brasstown drops a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/31/national/31POSS.html?8hpib">Possum.</a> From the NY Times:</p>

<blockquote>At midnight, as he lets a rope slip between his fingers, lowering a possum in a plexiglass cage from the roof of his gas station, Mr. Logan will call out, as he has every New Year's Eve since 1990, "5, 4, 3, 2, 1!"

<p> And then, as the crowd starts going bananas, "The possum has landed!"  The possum is alive, of course, and will be released at the end of the night unharmed, if a little shaken.</blockquote><br />
Meanwhile I plan to drop kick 2003 into history!</p>
