	<h3>Science Friday: What do they know that we don't</h3>
	
	<p>The Tala National Park is Sri Lanka's largest wildlife habitat with hundreds of elephants. The tsunami crashed inland by two miles here, yet... not one wild animal has been found dead.</p>

<p>Read about at Wired News:<a title="Wired News: How Did Animals Escape Tsunami?" href="http://www.wired.com/news/medtech/0,1286,66148,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_4">How Did Animals Escape Tsunami?</a></p>

<p>The article doesn't really answer the question, but it really does make one wonder.</p>

	<h3>Mind boggling</h3>
	
	<p>The last I checked, more than 80,000 people have died as result of the earthquake-tsunami. All I can do is to stare with my eyes wide open. Absolutely mind-boggling. The only thing I can think of to top this in sheer destruction is the toll of war.</p>

<p>I like that online businesses are offering their homepages to urge customers to give. <a href="http://s1.amazon.com/exec/varzea/ts/my-pay-page/PX3BEL97U9A4I/102-6097378-6148136">Amazon</a> has a direct way of contributing to the Red Cross (more than $3 million already). <a href="http:///www.apple.com">Apple</a> gave it's entire front page to promote giving. Google has a <a href="http://www.google.com/tsunami_relief.html">link</a> on it's homepage for links to give. You see this and go to a regular website and it almost seems callus.</p>

<p>I'm glad we upped our initial grant to the project from $15 to $35 million. I'd rather spend our tax dollars on this than some outrageously expensive spy satellite system that only works on clear days or on missle defense. </p>

<p>Mind you, I do think Bush is missing a huge opportunity. The area of Indonesia that is hardest hit is overwhelmingly Muslim. We could easily prove that we are not on a crusade here. However, to do that Bush needs to be in the forefront on this. Instead, he quietly sat in Crawford. In the long run I'm sure Bush will do right by the Indian Ocean community. He better.</p>

<p>[Update: Bush apparently was rather defensive in a press conference today about everything the US does for the relief effort. He should be, he should have opened his mouth immediately. But, hey, we are helping. That is good.]</p>

	<h3>The big melt</h3>
	
	<p>Madison, Indiana, the most beautiful slush city in America.</p>

<p>The "official" tally was 18-inches of snow in 24-hours. The total landed our county on the state's emergency disaster aid list in the state. That might help pay the overtime of our diehard snow guys. They did an awesome job even working through Christmas, though they did take turns going home for periods to be with family.</p>

<p>That subsequent freeze caused havoc on our town's guttering. Buildings all across downtown had huge icicles hanging from the roof as the downspouts froze over.</p>

<p>Across the street this morning, absolutely huge gutter-shaped chunks of ice came raining down on the sidewalk as the guttering collapsed.</p>

<p>Another building had their windows cracked by cascading ice. </p>

<p>At our library, a frozen downspout caused the melting snow and ice water to run down the side of the building and flooding into the children's room. We got the books off the shelf largely in time, though we lost maybe 8 books. When I pulled one of the wet books off the shelf, it was entitled-- "I Got Wet."</p>

<p>Go figure.</p>

	<h3>Our snow from Darlene's perspective</h3>
	
	<p><b>Editor's note</b>: <i>This is an edited version of what Darlene wrote my mom. It stated our situation so perfectly that I got her permission to post it here. Here's Darlene...</i></p>

<p>Imagine our downtown where many of the residents do not have off street parking.  Now imagine 17 inches of snow dumped on that town in less than 48 hours...</p>

<p>Jer and I returned this afternoon and I parked the van in the space we dug it out of.  As soon as I pulled all the way in, it occurred to me that getting back out could be a challenge.  Said parking space is still snow covered, a bit slippery, and the nose of the van is downhill a bit from the rear of the van.</p>

<p>Out of sheer stubborness I decided I was going to try to get van out myself and pick Jerry up at 5.  Felt I should have practice in doing this sort of thing as you never know when you might need the skills.  Proceeded outside.</p>

<p>Cardboard under wheels- no luck.  Moving van back and forth, no luck.  (only proceeded in moving to the far right side of the parking space) Hopped out of car to reposition cardboard.  Landed in 3 foot drift, slid out of drift to bounce on my kneecaps on the street. (3 points for humoring any onlookers at gas station). Repositioned cardboard, trudged back through snowdrift and tried again.  It is about 22 degrees outside and 2 kind boys on bikes volunteered to push. They were not very large, but quite insistent.  (a bit bored I suspect) No luck.  Man pulls up in truck, attaches chain to van and with boys pushing on other end I am freed!</p>

<p>Slowly make my way across slush covered streets to library where I happily drop the problem in Jerry's lap.  Ok hon, if we park in our space, we may not be able to get back out again.  Other spaces either have 4 foot drifts in them or cars covered in four foot drifts in them.  City lots are still snow covered.</p>

<p>Head to nearest city parking lot.  Maybe it was more usable than it appeared.  Just before pulling in ran into friend Ellen who had just her own car freed from the snow.  Jerry proceeds cautiously into lot not realizing where Ellen had just been freed from!  Immediately get stuck in same mess that Ellen had just been pulled from in said parking lot.  Ellen's husband and father in law and another friendly bystander along with Jerry proceed to push us out of drift and some kind (and probably exasperated) soul with a front loader plows a path to allow us to get out of the lot.</p>

<p>So with no other parking opportunities, we were forced back to our same sloping parking space that we dug ourselves out of Thursday and will probably have to be pushed out of Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>This is how we are managing the snow here in Madison. ( I am really glad we are not in Texas or Louisiana!)  I can't wait to see what happens when businesses and the courthouse, city hall etc. reopen tomorrow.</p>

<p>I asked for snow and so far I am still amused by it.</p>

	<h3>Couldn't resist</h3>
	
	<p>The call of family is rather strong at Christmas and we couldn't resist. We traveled to see Darlene's family in Ohio afterall. The roads in Indiana were passable, but the average speed was about 40 mph. The interstates in Ohio were actually pretty decent considering. I guess the winds were not as strong as the weathermen initially anticipated so the drifting stayed to a minimum.</p>

<p>We were settled in for the weekend when we talked with Darlene's father. The roads got cleared a lot faster than anyone thought so we made a last minute decision to come.</p>

<p>If everyone skipped Christmas we could have dealt with the disappointment, but with everyone being here, we couldn't skip it. Fortunately, by tonight everything was in pretty good shape.</p>

<p>Thank you Lord, let's celebrate Christmas!</p>

	<h3>Snippets from the snow zone</h3>
	
	<p><b>Planting the flag</b>: The pile of snow now in front of our shop is maybe five feet tall. We figured no one would see our sandwich sign that we were open today so Darlene climbed the snow mountain and planted our open flag on top. I'll post a photo later.</p>

<p><b>NekoBus unburied</b>: It took us more than an hour, but we managed to shovel our van out last night. We really have no desire to go anywhere, but I knew we wouldn't want to tackle it with temps in the single digits if we had an emergency. It was parked close to the corner, but the city dozer (pictured in previous post) was nicer to us and didn't dump any snow on us.</p>

<p><b>Not so lucky on Main</b>: One of our friends is a shopkeep that lives above her store on Main Street. Yesterday, she unburied her car so she could get to work today. Overnight the snow plow buried her in again-- five feet deep. </p>

<p>According to Darlene, she was mad as a hornet this morning. "I'm sending a bill to the governor. There were only two cars on the block, they could have put the snow behind me." </p>

<p>Knowing her luck the state, which plows Main Street, would probably say something like "a snow emergency means no cars on the street, parking included." It doubt it wouldn't mean anything to them that her nearest off street parking was two blocks away in a snow bound parking lot she couldn't get into.</p>

<p><b>No snowmen</b>: The snow is very heavy and a couple of my muscles were rather sore after shoveling. As heavy as it was, the stuff still too powdery. Darlene and I wanted to make a snowman infront of our shop, but it wouldn't ball up. Mind you the creation would have been buried by the plow. Would that have been considered murder?</p>

<p><b>Roundabout</b>: We heard from a customer that I-75 in Ohio is really slow going. The Ohio Dept. of Transportation website said much of it is snow covered and icy. Mind you, there are several variations of snow covered and icy. Is it, snowy but drivable or is it you're crazy to try it snowy and ice covered?</p>

<p> Louisville didn't get as much snow as we did, but they got a lot more ice and the roads are a mess.</p>

	<h3>Beep, beep, beep</h3>
	
	<p>I heard the backup alarms and scraping sounds loudly from our living room. I poked my head around the curtain and snapped some photos. We now have a mountain outside our front door.</p>

	<h3>White white white</h3>
	
	<p>According to the local paper we got 17 inches of snow. The temperature has not plunged yet so we walked around town and took about 80 photos with our digital camera. </p>

<p>Here are 21 of our favorite <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/egyarnetsky/PhotoAlbum2.html">photos</a> of the morning. [<b>UPDATE</b>: <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/egyarnetsky/PhotoAlbum3.html">More photos</a>] Click on any of the photos to start the slide show. Click on any of the slide photo shots for a bigger image.</p>

<p>Mind you, after a while you can only take so many photos of white stuff covering stuff.</p>

<p>it is supposed to get very windy and very cold over the next couple of days. Tonight they're calling for 3 above, a high of 11 tomorrow and -7 on Christmas eve. Wind chill of -25. ugh.  If it get's that cold, it looking like we may well skip going to family in Ohio for Christmas.</p>

<p>We got a call from Darlene's sister who said her husband, a truck drive, has been stuck all night at a truck stop just north of Findlay, Ohio. Poor guy. They have blizzard advisory right now.</p>

	<h3>Snow Day</h3>
	
	<p>Well, I went in for my noon to 9 p.m. shift and they were talking about closing early at 5 p.m. Then after lunch the director said, forget this, we're closing at 2 p.m. So two hours and 15 minutes into my shift, I was home again. </p>

<p>Depending on road conditions, they'll probably be closed again tomorrow. We're scheduled to be closed on Christmas Eve and Christmas. It will indeed be interesting on Sunday when I return. I suspect there will be a mountain of books to check in.</p>

<p>As noted the National Weather Service was talking seven inches of snow. Now they're talking 15 inches here in our little rivertown. At this pace, I wonder if we'll manage to get out of here Friday to visit family for the holidays. It shouldn't be too bad as it'll stop snowing tomorrow. By Friday afternoon the roads should be OK, but we'll check road conditions first.</p>

<p>We're trying to figure out what to do with our newfound time. I should probably clean our apartment, but the urge to take a nap is also alluring.</p>

<p>A snow plow just came around the corner. Darlene, looking out the window... "Oooh, even the snowplows are skidding. Please don't hit our van." It didn't.</p>

<p>It's still snowing and life goes on.</p>

	<h3>Snow and the 21st century</h3>
	
	<p>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas. A stack of gifts for family inside and a thickening bed of snow outside. </p>

<p>Also, the Christmas shoppers finally decended on us last Saturday and that put us at ease. We sold enough pots to keep our bills up to date this winter. It's rather odd to hope people will spend lots of money when we know its tough out there.  Nonetheless, this will probably be the first winter in our married lives that we can take out Chinese once a week and not feel guilty. Out of curiousity, Darlene talked with other merchants in downtown Madison and they're having the same luck-- it's pretty slow this year.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we are indeed getting our first "snow" of the winter. We had some flurries a week ago, but nothing stuck so it doesn't count. Our latest forecast called for four inches today and three more tonight (at one point they called for 10 inches--darn). </p>

<p>We're driving north for a quick Christmas and Darlene's family in the Lima, Ohio, area is expecting anything from 9 to 16 inches. Darlene's sister (one of four) loves the snow, so Darlene emailed her "don't get carried away" with prayers for white stuff so we can actually get into town. We have memories along those lines. </p>

<p>Several years ago we traveled up to her parents for Christmas and our station wagon broke down on the highway. It was 2 a.m. and it was barely above 0 degrees. We lucked out royally as the only deputy on duty in the whole county happened upon us and we got rescued by her father.</p>

<p>Well, this year it is again supposed to be frigid (in addition to the snow) so we did the unthinkable... we bought a cellphone. We were planning on getting one for my weekly commute to Indianapolis for grad school, but I wasn't planning on buying the thing until next year (OK, two weeks from now).</p>

<p>The experience was painful. I got a salesman at Radio Shack who was obviously trying to keep going as they had a long day. He kept saying things that weren't true and added some pressure sales to boot. I hate that because it makes it hard to determine whether the person is telling you the "truth" in order to make good decisions or if he has bills to pay and is trying to pad his commission. In the end I ended up spending about $80 more than I thought as I bought a car charger and a warrenty.</p>

<p>Part of the reason it was expensive is I decided to go with the "Pay As You Go" plan. If I don't use it much I only have to pay $15/mo. to keep the phone number instead of $30-$50 a month under a contract.</p>

<p>*Sigh* Some things about 21st century technology I love, like my Powerbook and wireless Internet, but I'm just not sure about cell phones.</p>

<p>So I could figure out how to use the damn thing, I took the phone with me to the grocery down the block and called Darlene. At least down here, the quality is a lot better than I expected. We've gotten cell calls that were really spotty and this one was crystal clear. After a few minutes I broke off the call to check out.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Darlene called me. It was stereotypical. I jumped with my eyes wide open as the phone vibrated in my pocket. It would have been funny if Darlene had said something to the effect of "Hi Darlin' is that a cell phone in your pocket or are you just glad to see me."</p>

	<h3>Great commercial</h3>
	
	<p>It's well known that word of mouth can really help or kill a business, but what happens when your fans start doing advertising for you?</p>

<p>Wired News take a look at a <a title="Wired News: Home-Brew IPod Ad Opens Eyes" href="http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,66001,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_2">"Home-Brew IPod Ad"</a> that is doing just that. </p>

	<h3>Science Saturday: Wisdom of the Masses</h3>
	
	<p>How many jelly beans are in that jar? To get a decent answer short of counting them, ask dozens of people individually and average the answers. You'll get darn close.</p>

<p>That's the jist of an <a title="Scientific American.com: Common Sense -- Surprising new research shows that crowds are often smarter than individuals" href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&colID=13&articleID=00049F3E-91E1-119B-8EA483414B7FFE9F">article</a> from the Scientific American about how new research shows crowds can more accurately figure things out than individuals. </p>

<p>However, according to the research, "for a group to be smart, it should be autonomous, decentralized and diverse." Basically, you've got to avoid mob rule.</p>

<p>I heard some of the examples before, but it got me to thinking about our democracy. </p>

<p>Right now so much of the information we receive is filtered through a rapidly consolidating media. Indeed, the GOP has mastered the echo chamber.</p>

<p>However, what if people received their information individually from a primary source and then acted on that information. Could this result in a better nation? </p>

<p>For example, what if every voter in the country individually went through all the raw intelligence on Iraq and voted on whether to go to war based on that intelligence, would we have done so?</p>

	<h3>Review: The Librarian</h3>
	
	<p>Sometimes a movie gets so hyped or has so many expectations that it is absolutely ruined. Yet, if you don't take them seriously they can still be a lot of fun. </p>

<p>Topping that list was Twister. The first time I saw it, I found myself repeatedly taking it apart. A year later our old downtown theatre reopened after a multi-year closure and Twister was the grand opening film. We went to help the new owners celebrate. That night was wonderful, a) because the Ohio Theatre is wonderful, but b) because I realized Twister was a funny movie. The line "I've got to go, we've got cows" will stay forever etched in my mind.</p>

<p>Well, when we heard TNT was produce an action-adventure flick called "The Librarian" everyone at our library was excited. Though I admit, most of my cohorts were interested because it starred Noah Wyle. </p>

<p>Now I haven't watched television (with occasional exceptions) for about a dozen years. We live in a 400-foot hole and we don't have cable. Thus everyone saw it before I did. People said it was cheesy, they complained the protagonist wasn't really a librarian. Heck, he never looked up an answer. </p>

<p>So, when our director brought in a video from the premier and offered me first dibs, I went into with low expectations. </p>

<p>Thank God I did because as a result I really enjoyed the movie. When you lower the bar, you can enjoy it for what it is-- a recreation of the grade-B movies. You know... The Killer Tomato that Ate Madison and their ilk. Darlene and I laughed the whole time. It was aweful, but in such a delicious fashion. Heck, I want to watch a sequel.</p>

<p>Heck, and any protagonist that can say, "but Mom, being a librarian is a pretty cool job," can't be all bad.</p>

<p>If you want to catch <a href="http://www.tnt.tv/Title/View4/0,5878,543783|5929||||~~~,00.html">The LIbrarian: Quest for the Spear</a> you can watch it on TNT tonight @ 11:45pm(ET), Sunday, Dec. 12th @ 11:45pm, Saturday, Dec. 18th @ 2pm and Sunday, Dece. 19th @ 10am.</p>

<p>Now I need to pass the video on to the next person in the library.</p>

	<h3>How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb</h3>
	
	<p>I bought U2's new CD for the library and had to get a listen to the puppy as Darlene is a big U2 fan.</p>

<p>Three things initially strike me about this album. </p>

<p>First, don't let your first listen dictate your opinion about this album. I keep wanting to go back and listen again and I'm liking it more with each listen. I later skimmed some reviews and found others had said as much.</p>

<p>Second, the music doesn't cut any new paths. Rather half the album reminded me of the music I loved in high school -- the New Wave-alt rock-MTV scene-- familiar, yet fresh. "All Because of You" makes me think Tom Petty, "City of Blinding Lights" a bit of Simple Minds.</p>

<p>Third, I've found U2 to be like reading the book then watching the movie. The movie pales in comparison. In the case of U2, their music has to be heard live to really appreciate. I heard live versions of both "Beautiful Day" and "Walk On" long before I heard the actual album. I'd pick the live version each time-- "All That You Can't Leave Behind" was over produced. </p>

<p>Most of the time I find myself liking just a couple songs from an album and being disappointed. So far I'm really enjoying half the album and I get the feeling the other half just hasn't snagged me yet. It's not on par with "The Joshua Tree," but it's good stuff.</p>

<p>Hmmm, U2's on tour next year, I wonder how much tickets will cost.</p>

	<h3>More on Social Security</h3>
	
	<p>Apparently, the Congressional Budget Office has reported that we could easily keep Social Security going into the 22nd Century with a little bit of fiscal responsibility. </p>

<p>New York Times columnist Paul Krugman suspects the GOP is <a title="The New York Times > Opinion > Op-Ed Columnist: Inventing a Crisis" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/07/opinion/07krugman.html?oref=login&hp">inventing a crisis</a> in order to destroy Social Security. It's an interesting read. I'll see if I can find a link to the original report.</p>

<p>I understand the GOP has a distaste for federal programs that don't line their pockets, but why don't they at least have the guts to say "let's cancel it" without driving us into debt first?</p>

	<h3>CSS Zen Garden and site changes</h3>
	
	<p>As you can see, my website has changed it's look yet again. </p>

<p>I see this as a natural progression as I've been using it not only to keep writing and to hop on a soap box, but also to teach myself CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). </p>

<p>I was inspired to dig back into the site design the other night when I saw the <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a> website. </p>

<p>CSS is pretty amazing stuff in the sense you can truly design with flexibility and grace. To prove the point the CSS Zen Garden takes the same HTML document and applies umpteen different style sheets. So far there are 150+ designs. Here's the portal to <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/alldesigns/">all the designs</a>. The conceptual and special effects sites are the coolest.</p>

<p>I didn't like having to scroll down to get to web or site links. It took me a while, but I finally figured out the method to the madness of three columns. That way I can put in a lot more links and information. I picked the colors pulling samples from our Egyptian Goose mascot. However, I'm not entirely happy with it--specifically the link boxes-- so I'll sit on it for a while to see what will pull it together.</p>

<p>If anyone has constructive criticism on the design, let me know.</p>

<p><b>Close commenting?</b></p>

<p>While I'm talking site design, I'm rather tempted to close off the comments for good. </p>

<p>First, real comments are far and few between as my audience (such as it is) isn't the commenting sort. Second, I'm constantly combating comment spammers. Third, I looked at my site statistics one day and at least a third of my traffic is from spammers.</p>

<p>I've managed to keep spamming to a minimum by closing off any posts older than five days and blacklisting known spam sites and spammers. Yet, why should I bother with someone who only wants one extra hit a day to their online poker or porn site?</p>

<p>What I'm thinking of doing instead is putting up an email link where people can send comments or story ideas. Unless it is a personal note, I'll post the emails in a "mailbag" post.</p>

	<h3>Kiln down and up</h3>
	
	<p>We've held our open house the past two weekends and we survived in spite of ourselves. Our sales were lower than expected, but we would have been dead meat if they were high as we were not able to get pots out of our kiln for the past week -- so it balances out.</p>

<p>We kept getting an "error one" on our kiln's computer controller. That means one of three things-- there's an element dead, we're not getting enough electrical draw or a relay is out. </p>

<p>The kiln was supposed to fire to 2200F and it died at 1750F. We let it cool and opened up the controller and there was a very loose wire so we started her up again. It died at 1750F again. So we called in an electrical engineer sort who was able to test to see if we were pulling enough amps and whether the relays were working.</p>

<p>It turned out one of the three relays died. Fortunately, our supplier in Cincinnati, <a href="http://www.anniesmudpieshop.com">Annie's Mudpie Shop</a>, carried the part and I made an emergency run to snag it yesterday. Our friend installed it today and it's been running great. We are now within 20 degrees of a complete firing. Finally.</p>

<p>Mind you, the trip to Cinci also allowed Darlene to grab some chemicals and I got to stop at Half Price Books-- I bought two manga (Oh My Goddess) and a anime DVD (Sherlock Hound), lightweight, but very fun.</p>

<p>Darlene's going to check the kiln and I think it'll be done for the first time in too long. Then we can crash ourselves.</p>

	<h3>Initial Social Security thoughts</h3>
	
	<p>Darlene and I were debating with a conservative friend about Social Security the other night. Yes, we have a number of conservative friends-- they like us anyway.</p>

<p>The jist is we agree Social Security was technically in trouble as the baby boomers greatly outnumber us Gen Xers. (Yes, I am among the oldest of the slacker generation). How do we solve that problem and keep social security solvent? Pay into it but forfeit our retirement? That's what it looks like so far as they figure it'll be broke by the time I'm ready to retire.</p>

<p>The Republican option, as little as I've read about it so far, is to allow us younger pups to put money aside into dedicated retirement funds we could invest in the markets.</p>

<p>I'd like to hear more on possible solutions as it's obvious something needs to happen, but so far I see two problems with this solution. </p>

<p>First, in order to liberate the younger folks' money into these accounts, the government would have to borrow tanker loads of money. The problem is who will pay this debt? The same generations the solution is supposed to serve. I see this as a break even proposition at best. As it is, we are falling seriously in debt due to the tax cuts for the baby boomers. (Hey, after race wars and class wars, isn't the age wars next?)</p>

<p>Second, the markets can be awesome for growing nest eggs, my grandfather has some success in that category, but there is significant risk. If it crashes when you are getting ready to retire, you can be screwed for years.</p>

<p>I'm seeing this now in the library world. There is a generation of librarians that were about to retire causing a well publicized and anticipated shortage (thus jobs for me). However, many of these good folks are delaying that decision because they lost a chunk of their 401K accounts in the tech bubble burst. Now must work an extra number of years. </p>

<p>This post came about when I read today that librarians are not the only ones having problems with the markets. Apparently, our beloved Republican Senate Majority Leader Dr. Bill Frist lost <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26558-2004Dec1.html">nearly a half-million dollars</a> in campaign funds on the market in the last few years.</p>

<p>Finally, one more thought just hit me. When a government contractor (Halliburton) can't figure out what happened to a third of the money that was supposed to be used for Iraqi reconstruction and troop support, who do we trust to invest our money? Will the investment bankers be getting a free pass to abuse our accounts or will there be checks and balances built into the system?</p>

		<h2>12.03.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Bush was right</h3>
	
	<p>After a month of "oh Good Lord, what have we gotten ourselves into," I'm once again somewhat optimistic about our future.</p>

<p>Why? Because I realize that George W. Bush is right. </p>

<p>About one thing and eventually it will be the downfall of this fascist-leaning right-wing Republican leadership.</p>

<p>Repeatedly, Bush has said something along the lines of <a href="http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?ID=19486">this</a> (from Baptist Press News):<br />
<blockquote>"You cannot lead this world and our country to a better tomorrow unless you ... have a vision of a better tomorrow," the president said. "And I've got one, based upon a great faith that people do want to be free and live in democracy."<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>People do want to be free and live in democracy. Yes, Mr. President, indeed they do.</p>

<p>I truly believe people are willing to share and contribute toward the common welfare of the country and its citizens. Yet, beyond that, Americans really don't want the government to stick their nose in their business. We don't want a prosecutor in our closest. </p>

<p>Republicans assume that means we don't want them in our gun closet and for many that is entirely true. But from there they tend to lose track of reality. We don't want them checking out our religious beliefs, our sexuality, our livelihood, our breeding practices (or lack thereof), or (my personal pet peeve) our reading materials. You could easily add to this list on and on because we indeed all want freedom.</p>

<p>The problem is this freedom is slowly being infringed upon. There are many ways we should work together towards the common good, but there is a line and if their actions match their rhetoric, the Republicans will shortly be crossing that line and the pendulum will slowly swing the other way.</p>
