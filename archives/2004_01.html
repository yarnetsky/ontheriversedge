	<h3>I love css, I hate css and boy it's cold</h3>
	
	<p>I've always heard that 3-column formats using css can be difficult. I'm learning so first hand. If I can debug this template, I'll be extremely happy. Nonetheless I love what css can do for a website. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we've been comfortable even though it got below 0 last night. I weatherized our apartment more this winter than last. Last year we were losing all our heat up the grand staircase to the third floor and we often needed four layers of blankets to stay warm. This year I put plastic along the staircase and the heat flows into the second floor instead. That and I found which windows were killing us.</p>

<p>It's actually gotten above 15 degrees out so if we're going to go for a walk, now is the time.</p>

	<h3>Indian coffee and books</h3>
	
	<p>Here's a fun article I found at <a href="http://www.lisnews.com">LISnews</a>. A library in India is adding coffee to their repertoire.</p>

<blockquote>"As tandoori is to Punjabis, as Laloo is to politicians, as Ekta Kapoor is to the idiot box, as Salman Rushdie is to Indian authors writing in EnglishÖ coffee is to books!"</blockquote>

<p>Courtesy of the <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cms.dll/html/uncomp/articleshow/454080.cms">Times of India</a>. I'd love to have coffee and bagels at our library.</p>

	<h3>Pots out of the kiln</h3>
	
	<p>Here's one of the sculptures Darlene took out of the kiln this week. We've just set up a spot on our third floor where we can take photos of the pots. This is the first endeavor. The lighting needs a little work, but the pot is beautiful.</p>

	<h3>Nice window displays</h3>
	
	<p>We have two display windows in the foyer before you enter our library. They're usually its an assortment of books on a given topic, but this time we outdid ourselves.</p>

<p>Julie H. put together a really neat display of paper dolls and a woman who is teaching a basket making class here at the library brought in a portion of her basket collection. They are absolutely beautiful.</p>

<p>So if you're near the Madison-Jefferson County PUblic Library at 420 W. Main St., Madison IN 47250. It is well worth the stop.</p>

	<h3>As Bush quietly walks away</h3>
	
	<p>OK, maybe a long primary season isn't such a good idea. Here's an instance where I wish the Demos were not making headlines because this one should be splashed across page one.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/28/politics/28PREX.html?hp">Bush Backs Away From His Claims About Iraq Arms</a></p>

<p>I hope the 9/11 panel gets more time because there are a lot of questions that need honest answers. Then again, they probably wouldn't need more time if the White House hadn't stonewalled them to begin with.</p>

	<h3>Like something from Spirit's camera</h3>
	
	<p>Heading down the grand staircase from our apartment, I can peer out the big front windows onto the street. The ice from Sunday's storm is piled up in rocky jumbles at the curb. </p>

	<h3>Hoping for a nice long primary?</h3>
	
	<p>Well, Kerry has won two and the gang all heads south.</p>

<p>Some are hoping the Democrats can settle on a candidate early to rally around, but I just read an interesting viewpoint on the <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2004/1/28/15713/7367">Daily Kos</a> political blog. </p>

<p>"Kos" has assembled a very interesting set of correspondents for his blog and the comments, which can range into the hundreds, are generally well thought.</p>

<p>In a comment, "gttim" noted that as soon as the "race" for the nomination ends, the press coverage will die allowing Bush to get the upper hand in the media. </p>

<p>Thus, as long as there's a good primary battle going, there are several people constantly rattling the White House gates. That's definitely an upside to a long primary season. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the downside is bleeding the candidates campaign chests' dry just as they need cash to faceoff with the $200 million man.</p>

<p>But again, it will all be decided before I will have a say in the matter. Indiana's primary is May 4.</p>

	<h3>When Opportunity knocks</h3>
	
	<p>It sure is fun to find the NASA scientists with the jaws on the ground.</p>

<p>The second Mars rover "Opportunity" couldn't have landed in a more interesting spot on Mars. Smack dab in a crater with a layer dusty grey hematite covering Martian bedrock. What caused the stuff? Volcanos? Water? Awesome stuff.</p>

<p>Seeing the first photo of the deep red stuff, Darlene, spoken like a true potter, couldn't resist wanting some to glaze her pots with.</p>

<p>I loved the quote from Dr. Squyres in today's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/26/science/space/26MARS.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1075129689-vB7OPWBIAkS2qzshiUuA8A">NY Times</a>. </p>

<blockquote>To Dr. Steven W. Squyres, the dark, surreal landscape encircling the Mars rover Opportunity resembled only one other place.

<p> "This is exactly what it looked like in my wildest dreams," said Dr. Squyres, a professor of astronomy at Cornell University who is principal investigator for the two NASA rovers currently on Mars..... </p>

<p>Dr. Squyres said he had expected Opportunity, at best, to land close enough to reach a crater. "Instead, what has happened is that we have scored a 300-million-mile interplanetary hole in one," he said Sunday afternoon. Opportunity, he said, appears to be inside a shallow  crater about 20 yards wide and a couple of yards deep.</blockquote></p>

<p>With a shot like that their handicap should go down quite a bit.</p>

	<h3>Up in a plume of flame and a poof of smoke</h3>
	
	<p>our microwave died today. May it's 2.6ghz soul rest in peace.</p>

<p>It's not surprising really as it hadn't been working well lately. However, its last symptoms were bizarre indeed.</p>

<p>We have a florescent light in our living/bedroom that hasn't worked properly for about six months now. This morning it was on and everything else in the apartment was barely running.</p>

<p>Our lights and our plugs are on two different circuits so it made no sense to me why when a light kicks on that our humidifier would kick off, but it did. We turned off the lights and the plugs would die. Turn on the lights and plugs come alive. These puppies are on two different circuits!</p>

<p>So we call our friend who's working on our electricity and he showed up within an hour.</p>

<p>After some messing around with the wiring we heard a huge pop and saw our microwave catch on fire with flames shooting out the bottom.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Darlene was right there and was able to cut the juice and the whole thing died in a huge poof of smoke. From that point on, everything was working in its normal fashion again. </p>

<p>As close as we can figure, the people who originally installed the electric put two hot wires and only one neutral in the same conduit. The surge from the microwave somehow bridged the two circuits.</p>

<p>Hmm, I wonder how much microwaves cost. We haven't been in the market for one for a while as we've had this one nearly as long as we've been married.</p>

		<h2>01.24.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>A rant about an alleged "rant"</h3>
	
	<p>Living in this "city 'neath the hills" we don't watch TV. When we moved here we didn't have money for cable and now we don't care.</p>

<p>Thus, for nearly a week now, I've been <i>reading</i> about how the Iowa "I have a screech" speech was "bizarre" and "damaging" to his campaign.</p>

<p>Finally, I searched for and found a video of <a href="http://webmastersforamerica.com/Idiom_Studio/Default.html">Dean's speech</a> on the net. </p>

<p>Darlene and I watched it together and looked at each other. Our reaction? With raised eyebrows we asked "<b>WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?</b>"</p>

<p>The video was taken by a person in the 3,000+ crowd. From their perspective the speech is fine. It makes perfect sense.</p>

<p>Dean had lost and he had a ballroom full of disappointed campaign workers. The experiment of asking people from around the country to show up and campaign had essentially failed. The numbers were there, but these folks were young and very inexperienced.</p>

<p>Secondly, you can tell he's losing his voice. Indeed, the media noted that just about every candidate was hoarse by the end.</p>

<p>Third, the place was a loud! He started talking, but you could hardly hear him. He had to yell to be heard over the crowd.</p>

<p>Watching it from their standpoint, it sounded like a rallying speech. Yes, he was passionate, but not unlike a football coach rallying his freshman squad.</p>

<p>As Judy Dean said, you could see it as maybe a "little silly," but that's it. </p>

<p>The reporters who covered the speech from the scene did a good job. But within a day the media fell into a pattern of rather pitiful coverage. I'm embarassed for the reporters who were sucked into this one. </p>

<p>Here's the <a href="http://www.cjr.org/blog/archives/cat_spin_buster.asp#000051%23more">Columbia Journalism Review's</a> take on the event.</p>

	<h3>In the past 20 years,</h3>
	
	<p>In the past 20 years, the Republicans have brilliantly developed the method "framing" issues to steer voters in their favor. It's not much different from a reporter asking a "leading question." You bias a question with the intent of getting a specific answer. </p>

<p>While this can be a legitimate means of campaigning, it also results in a slew of misinformation or misdirection from the truth.</p>

<p>In addition to the CJR's Campaign Desk, The Annnenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania has started a new website called <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/">FactCheck.org</a> that aims to peer through this fog.</p>

<p>I haven't read through the whole site, but it appears to blow up the urban myths of campaigns. For example was Bush a "deserter" as Michael Moore claims? Was Wesley Clark a Republican? What Bush left unsaid in the State of the Union Address.</p>

<p>They also have an email service to receive the updates as soon as they're published.</p>

	<h3>Campaign journalists can occasionally be</h3>
	
	<p>Campaign journalists can occasionally be a bunch of seagulls. They fly after the same scraps, they sing the same song and can easily be lead away by someone with a morsel to eat.</p>

<p>In the process, they occasionally miss the story or make errors. BUT, reading, listening or watching the news, you wouldn't know it.</p>

<p>Coming to the rescue is the Columbia Journalism Review which created <a href="http://campaigndesk.org/">CampaignDesk.org</a> to track all this stuff-- everything from distortions and cheap shots to a tip of the hat to the reporters who are doing their job.</p>

<p>I've been a reporter and IT IS TOUGH!!!! I've made errors in political reporting that I wish I had not made. Nonetheless, I appreciate what CJR is doing and it's good reading for someone trying to understand the whole story of these elections.</p>

	<h3>"Cool! I want to go tomorrow!"-- Ben, age 5</h3>
	
	<p>They were clumped together by the dozen, hanging from the ceiling hibernating.</p>

<p>Darlene and I went with our friends Caryl and Laura and Laura's two sons to Clifty Falls State Park this afternoon in the sultry 22 degree weather for a hike.</p>

<p>There's a century old railroad tunnel at the park. A guy, who was later Governor of Ohio, tried to build a railroad through Madison, but went bankrupt before he managed to get the thing finished. "Brough's Folly" has left behind a few interesting artifacts including the incomplete tunnel through the canyon bluffs of Clifty Creek.</p>

<p>The entrance has several underground creeks running nearby so the ceiling of the tunnel was covered with icicle stalactites.</p>

<p>Somehow we managed to convince the two boys, the oldest of whom is 5, to go through the tunnel. They were a bit scared at first, but I encouraged them by showing them all the fun things in there.</p>

<p>I held Ben's hand while Caryl took younger Alex and we walked them through over the rocks that have fallen over the decades and trying to avoid the standing water on the bottom of the tunnel.</p>

<p>At one place, the whole ceiling fell out and with our good flashlight you could see a couple dozen feet into the hole above us.</p>

<p>Then there's the underground creek that carved a crevice in the ceiling. There was a waterfall there today and the wall was encrusted with iron deposits. That was cool, but showing them the big spiders in the crevice evenly spaced every six inches was "Cool!!"</p>

<p>Ben wanted to turn back, but I encouraged him to go just a little further so he could see my favorite part of the tunnel in the winter. He grudingly agreed.</p>

<p>Fortunately, soon we were able to see either side of the tunnel and that encouraged him.</p>

<p>We got about halfway when we found them, probably 100 or so bats hibernating in clumps of 4 to 40 bats each.</p>

<p>Ben's first reaction was "aargh! bats!" But I shined my light at them and showed him how they were furry with cat-like ears. "Aren't they cute Ben?" "Awww, yeah..."</p>

<p>He then took the flashlight and searched the ceiling and walls for more. "There's some and there some."</p>

<p>Boy, it's fun when you can get a kid whose scared of something and turn them into a big fan. "Boy this is fun!" I helped him climb over huge boulders on the other side. He was a real trooper.</p>

<p>Their mom is due with the third brother in April, so we promised that we'd take the boys playing some more this spring.</p>

<p><b>Whenever I think of bats (rated PG-13 parental discretion is advised).</b></p>

<p>I had a blast, but whenever I think of bats, I can't help to think about the book "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas." </p>

<p>I've never read the book, but an old friend once did a radio show where he played "road trip music" and between tunes read from books about road trips. He read a passage where the main characters are having to cover some sort of event in Las Vegas, but en route decided to go to LA and buy huge quantities of drugs and take them all en route to LV. After a ungodly dose of ether, the protagonist (if you want to call him that) starts to hallucinate.</p>

<blockquote>"We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold. I remember saying something like "I feel a bit lightheaded; maybe you should drive ..." And suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats, all swooping and screeching and diving around the car, which was going about a hundred miles an hour with the top down to Las Vegas. And a voice was screaming: "Holy Jesus! What are these goddam animals?"
 Then it was quiet again. My attorney had taken his shirt off and was pouring beer on his chest, to facitate the the tanning process. "What the hell are you yelling about?" he muttered, staring up at the sun with his eyes closed and covered with wraparound Spanish sunglasses. "Never mind", I said. "It's your turn to drive."I hit the brakes and aimed the Great Red Shark toward the shoulder of the highway. No point mentioning those bats, I thought. The poor bastard will see them soon enough.</blockquote>

	<h3>4000 years of miniature books</h3>
	
	<p>To get the headlines posted on my website, I long ago subscribed to a service called <a href="http://www.moreover.com">Moreover</a>. I don't think they offer the service for free any longer. I'm lucky to be grandfathered in.</p>

<p>It doesn't always give the greatest selection of headlines, but for a computer driven program it leads to some interesting stories, many international.</p>

	<h3>Bush's approval rating drops from 60% to 50% - Immigration proposal falls flat†</h3>
	
	<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/17/opinion/polls/main593849.shtml">The latest CBS News/NY Times poll</a> has Bush taking a big drop in the latest approval polls to equal the lowest of his administration.</p>

<p>On one hand the constant polling of America drive me crazy because it makes it too easy for reporters to write "horse race" stories during an election year. </p>

<p>However, I find it interesting that his two latest "think big" initiatives are falling flat.</p>

<p>The proposed immigration policy appears to have hit a raw nerve. Several of our more conservative friends are mad as hornets over the proposal. Unfortunately I didn't get to talk to them long enough to find out why.</p>

<p>If the economy hadn't dumped 3 million jobs, I think people would be more open to his proposal. Even if the competition for jobs is more imagined than real, people are feeling defensive.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I agree the United States needs to rethink it's immigration policies. On a simple human rights basis, it's sad that people subject themselves to near death experiences to make it here.</p>

<p>Also, as much as I hate to say it, I agree with Bush that there are jobs people no longer want to take. </p>

<p>Why are there jobs Americans don't want? I think there are several elements at work. </p>

<p>First off, we're consuming more and more and wanting more and more services. </p>

<p>"Hello, welcome to Taco Bell, would you like to try our new bean, cheese and rice burrito today?"<br />
"No thank you, I'll take a 7-Layer Burrito please."<br />
"Would you like hot or mild sauce with that?<br />
"No thank you"<br />
"That'll be $1.73, please pull around"</p>

<p>In this scenario, the kid on the other side of the microphone knows there's 10 more jobs just like this one waiting for him if he wants to quit tomorrow. A couple of our friends who run restaurants have learned this one the hard way.</p>

<p>Then there is Walmart. </p>

<p>Walmart is getting us great prices. I admit that I find it hard to pay $4 for a box of cereal at Krogers when I know I can get the same box for $2.75 at Wally World. I just don't make enough to pay $4 for cereal.</p>

<p>Yet, there is a flip side to this. To give us great prices, Walmart is pushing down wages everywhere else. Not only what it pays its own employees, but also what it's willing to pay suppliers for goods.</p>

<p>The suppliers in turn, to make a profit, can't pay its employees all that much. For agriculture, this means immigrants. For manufacturing, it means going overseas.</p>

<p>Because neither the service economy jobs, nor the Walmart jobs pay diddly, people are less willing to take them -- unless they don't have the option.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we also know a lot people who don't have the option to turn down Walmart jobs as Madison does not have many well paying jobs either.</p>

<p>Again, if we hadn't lost so many jobs in the past couple of years, people wouldn't even think about these jobs. But today, I think they are.</p>

<p>But then there are the minority who believe they're the only true Americans and that immigration should be cut. I won't tell them that they're only the fourth-generation to live on our soil if you won't.</p>

<p>Personally, I like immigration. It keeps this country vibrant. We're getting a decent number of Latinos and Asians coming into town and I think it's exciting that our pleasent, though white bread, community is getting a little diversity.</p>

	<h3>Nice discounts at Apple†</h3>
	
	<p>There are a couple of perks to being a government employee (not many, but a few). The <a href="http://www.apple.com/r/store/government/">Apple Store</a> offers 50% discounts on all Apple software and 10-25% discounts on hardware.</p>

<p>For example, everyone pays $129 for MacOSX 10.3. I'll be paying $68. iLife 2004? $24.50 instead of $49. iPod mini? $224 instead of $249.</p>

	<h3>Letter to Congressman Baron Hill†</h3>
	
	<p>Dear Sir,<br />
 <br />
 Our nation's space program definitely needs a new set of priorities to succeed in the 21st century. A shuttle replacement is a decade overdue and ISS has been a funding black hole.<br />
 <br />
 But cutting Hubbel in the process toward a manned trip to Mars grates my nerves. The Hubbel has done nothing short of revolutionizing astronomy and we should endeavor to keep it going until the new Webb telescope can take its place beside it. Combining the power of the two telescopes could exponentially increase the data.<br />
 <br />
 This alone would give us a much better understanding of our universe than a trip to Mars.<br />
 <br />
 You need to keep planning for manned space flight, but if Bush is only going to give NASA another $1 billion over five years, we'd get a lot more science out of robots. Instead we will be short changing every mission to gain enough money to get back to the moon. I can't imagine constructing a moon base would be cheaper then Alpha. I'd rather be visiting comets, asteroids and the planets.<br />
 <br />
 Thus I'm skeptical of the administration's motivations. When the president shoots for the moon, but gives you a budget for a vacation, something's wrong.<br />
 <br />
 sincerely,<br />
 <br />
 E.G. Yarnetsky<br />
 Madison, Indiana<br />
 The most beautiful rivertown in America</p>

	<h3>Vacation's here</h3>
	
	<p>Actually, I decided to consider it two back to back four-day weekends with a three day vacation in between. I won't be going back to work until Tuesday, Jan. 27.</p>

<p>Now it's a question of what am I going to do with myself. I've decided to upgrade my blog, if only for the heck of it. I'm reviewing a switch from Blogger to <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> which will allow me to have catagories for my posts among other interesting features.</p>

<p>I think I'll finally force myself to continue studying for the GRE. Bush might want to be on the moon or Mars by 2017, I can get my MLS by the time I'm 40.</p>

<p>There's some cleaning in my future! Wow! Some walks, naps, maybe a trip to Louisville. Some cards with friends, some reading.</p>

<p>Heading my reading list is a "Shadow of Death" by William Tapply, "A Handbook for Fighting Back" by James Carville and "Google Hacks."</p>

	<h3>Sheyl Crow is one of</h3>
	
	<p>Sheyl Crow is one of those singers where I either love or hate the song. </p>

<p>Her tunes fall into two catagories, the sad "I'm a broken woman" sorts and the "I'm in southern Cal soaking up the sun when everyone else in the world is broken and crazy." I guess those are the kinds of tunes her voice can manage.</p>

<p>In general it is the later that are my favorites. "Soak Up the Sun" and "Everyday is a Winding Road" are some of the best road tunes of the decade.</p>

<p>The rest... well there's 17 tunes and I'd have dumped five of them off the CD. Nonetheless, I bought the CD for the library collection. Grade: B.</p>

<p>It's frustrating. When there are thousands of CDs issued every year, sometimes buying greatest hits packages is the only way to get a good sampling in the collection.</p>

	<h3>Good fortune?</h3>
	
	<p>Darlene and I are suckers for eating Chinese. It's a cheap night out. For $5 we can both have a bowl of soup and an egg roll. For $10 we can stuff ourselves silly with Triple Delight, white rice, soup and egg roll.</p>

<p>Of course we snag fortune cookies. We open them at the same time and then we count down from three and try to snap them simultaneously.</p>

<p>Well, I've been getting a few interesting ones lately:</p>

<p>"Life to you is a dashing and bold adventure"<br />
"Be prepared to accept a wondrous opportunity in the days ahead!"<br />
"It's doing good with what you've got that lights the morning star."<br />
"You are interested in public service and would make an outstanding statesman."</p>

<p>Huh?!?!?</p>

<p>Well I opened a "fortune chocolate" today (a bunch of chocolate hearts packed in a Chinese food takeout container) and it said "keep your plans secret."</p>

<p>Then of course there are the lucky numbers. Here are some if you want to play the lottery. If you win, send me a tip.</p>

<p>6, 8, 16, 28, 21, 31<br />
64, 15, 13, 23, 8, 40<br />

	<h3>Butching up for Victory</h3>
	
	<p>A slightly bizarre article from The Nation that believes Dean is ahead of the Democratic pack because he's more <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20040126&s=goldstein&c=1">"butch"</a> then the rest of the gang. </p>

<p>The writer ponders whether the Republicans have substituted sex-roles for race in twisting Americans voting patterns. How does the cardiganed Carter compete against the he-man Reagan? He doesn't. Indeed, the author wonders if Bush's flight suit was padded to emphasize his he-man status.</p>

<p>Yet, it's also argued that his "Mission Accomplished" flight deck landing gives Dean points toward stating Bush is "All hat and no cattle."</p>

<p>Go figure...</p>

	<h3>Why am I not surprised?†</h3>
	
	<p>From day one, it felt like the 9-11 was more an excuse to invade Iraq than a reason. Why? Because before the war the reasons for invading kept changing. Afterward the invasion, the reasons kept changing. Now Bush even himself has told the press that "it doesn't matter" what the reason was.</p>

<p>Thus I found it not surprise when from former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill told former Wall St. Journal reporter Ron Suskind that <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/09/60minutes/main592330.shtml?cmp=EM8707">Bush sought a "way" to invade Iraq</a> from nearly day one of his administration.</p>

	<h3>I'm dangerous! I read! Heck I might even have an almanac in my car†</h3>
	
	<p>Good grief! I thought I had heard everything. Now the FBI has issued an advisory prompting police to keep an eye out for people carrying almanacs in their cars. </p>

<p>They argue that almanacs are full with information which could be valuable to a terrorist. No joke, the Associated Press confirmed it.</p>

<p>This kind of information can be found anywhere. If a person has a laptop with a wi-fi card in it, they can get on the net in almost any city. There's all the terrorist info you could possible need.</p>

<p>Thus I think the FBI should stop every businessperson in NYC to check the history in their web browser for possible terrorist links.</p>

<p>Heck, just shut down the Internet, censor the newspapers and close the libraries and bookstores while you're at it.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice may or may not have requested lists of what patrons are reading courtesy of the Patriot Act, but the government sure seems to have curious, literate people in their crosshairs.</p>

<p>Here's an article about it from Witchita, Kans. <a href="http://www.kansas.com/mld/kansas/7682394.htm">An almanac of worries for librarians after Sept. 11</a></p>

	<h3>"The Love Bug" Darlene and</h3>
	
	<p><b>"The Love Bug"</b> <br />
Darlene and I have recently watched several classic Disney flicks including "The Absent Minded Professor" and "The Shaggy Dog". Good stuff actually. The Love Bug mixed a good dose of automotive philosphy with 60s humor yet it never seemed forced. Buddy Hackett was great and Dean Jones was perfect as a person who was "half a man" if he wasn't racing cars.</p>

<p><b>"Charade"</b> <br />
Cary Grant and Audry Hepburn star in this thriller where you are not quite sure if Grant is a good guy or murderer, yet the two get along famously. Lots of romantic wit and suspense. Great date movie. Grade A- as Hepburn's a bit too sappy at times.</p>

<p><b>New on DVD</b><br />
Two movies that just came out in video/DVD that are really good. "Finding Nemo" and "Bend It Like Beckham."</p>

	<h3>Jimmy Buffett "Meet Me in</h3>
	
	<p><b>Jimmy Buffett</b> "Meet Me in Margaritaville." </p>

<p>This is Buffett's latest greatest hits package. There are a few good tunes I had not heard and a few mildly disappointing live versions of favorites. I liked "Feeding Frenzy" better. B-</p>

<p><br />
<b>The Mighty Lemon Drops</b> "World Without End" </p>

<p>A late 80s British band. The first half is pretty good punk pop. The second half is a bit slow. The tune "Inside Out" is great. B-</p>

<p><br />
<b>Dave Brubeck Quartet</b> "Time Out" </p>

<p>Here's an oldie but goodie jazz album I listened to as a kid and have rediscovered. The album's lead piece "Blue Rondo A La Turk" is even better than "Take Five" which became a hit. Later in an interview, Dave Brubeck said "Take Five" was never intended to be more than a wonderful, albeit glorified, drum solo. Grade A-</p>

	<h3>When I was a kid,</h3>
	
	<p>When I was a kid, this was my favorite series of mysteries. </p>

<p>I found one at a bookstore once and have been collecting them since. They're a lot of fun, good solid fluff reading now, but definitely a good read for 3-5 graders. </p>

<p>The series features three California boys who together formed an investigation agency that tackles the craziest mysteries featuring things from singing serpents and crooked cats to screaming clocks and dancing devils. </p>

<p>The mysteries are puzzles, but fair-- a sharp kid can solve them along with first investigator Jupiter Jones. </p>

<p>I love their business card. It features three question marks ??? ‚ÄúThe question mark is the universal symbol of something unknown. We are prepared to solve any puzzle, riddle, mystery, enigma, or conundrum which may be brought to us,‚Äù Jupiter Jones explains in the first book. </p>

<p>As a reference assistant and someone who loves to encourage kids to read, these guys are my heroes.</p>

	<h3>Blog changes</h3>
	
	<p>I decided it was too hard to update the read, listen, watch, surf section of my blog, so I decided to spin it off into a blog of it's own.</p>

<p>I'll start with old entries, but new stuff will show up. Including, but not limited to good books (my mom's been passing along some books including a cool sounding series that will help pass the time until Harry Potter comes out), good music, good movies and good stuff on the web.</p>

<p>I'm doing this in part as an experiment I hope to transfer to our library's homepage sometime this year. We want to start a program where we have "staff picks," but also "readers picks." I think a blog could help pull this off.</p>

<p>If you have a favorite, pass it along and I'll post it.</p>

<p>I'm replacing these features on my blog with the day's headlines. Read them and weep.</p>

	<h3>Things are a little blurry</h3>
	
	<p>If I look blurry-eyed tomorrow, it's not because I just woke up. It's because I am indeed blurry-eyed.</p>

<p>The screw on the left lens kept popping out and I thought I had it fixed with a new screw. But it too came out so Darlene used some string to hold it together. We were going to get them fixed today when the string broke. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can't find the lens. I just don't remember it falling out. I fear it happened while we were on our walk this afternoon and the lens is out on the street somewhere.</p>

<p>Worst case scenario I'm without my glasses until next week. I can order a replacement on Monday, but I may not get it for several days.</p>

<p>Thus I think I'll be the opposite of "bright-eyed and bushy-tailed" for a few days.</p>

	<h3>Grant writing</h3>
	
	<p>I'm tripping through the wires of grant writing today. I've never written a grant and now I'm trying to get a couple thousand dollars through the federal Library Services and Technology Assistance grant program.</p>

<p>We hope to have wireless access to the Internet and our network throughout the library using "wi-fi" or 802.11g technology. It's pretty cool stuff actually, it's what allows me to surf the web in bed if I want as we have wi-fi in our building.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I have a number of people to rely on to bend this thing into a form that might actually secure a grant. Our assistant director has written grants but knows little about techology. I'm vise-versa. We'll be turning it in next week. I'll let you all know how it turns out.</p>

	<h3>534,000 cubic feet per second and -10F</h3>
	
	<p>Boy is it cold tonight. We're looking to bottom out at 4F with wind chill of -10F. Darlene and I pledged to walk after work and we only got down to the river and back (four blocks).</p>

<p>As frigid as it was, it was worth the walk, because our river is moving and fast. All the rain and snow that socked the Northeast and Midwest is flowing past the foot of our street.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="http://www.crh.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ahps.cgi?LMK&clfi3">National Weather Service</a> the Ohio River is flowing by our street at a rate of 534,000 cubic feet per second. The river is wild and as wide as a lake.</p>

<p>The river depth this morning was observed at 44.4 ft and was forecast to peak at 45.2 feet. Observing the line of grunge left behind, it looked as if it had just peaked when we were down there this evening.</p>

<p>Another foot or so and it would have covered some low lying roads. The river gets this high at least once every other year.</p>

<p>Normality? Normal depth around 20 feet and the historic average flow for January is 147,000 ft3/s.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, our apartment is staying moderately comfortable. We are wearing sweat jackets, but at least we're not cold. Putting plastic over our windows is paying off. The studio however is freezing between heating cycles.</p>

<p>I got home for lunch today to find Darlene laid out on our bed playing with our computer. Our computer! It came back!</p>

<p>Just before lunch Airborne Express dropped off the box with our Apple iBook enclosed. We had just dropped the puppy off at the Cincinnati Apple Store on Friday. They said the turnaround averaged 5-7 days. We're used to people meaning business days so we didn't expect it back until the end of the week at the earliest.</p>

<p>As requested they repaired my modem, power plug and the screen is looking as good as ever! I can open it again without it flicking off! To do all this I know they had to break it into pieces.</p>

<p>Better yet, they not only repaired those three things, but they also did some nice additional work as well.</p>

<p>The period key that broke off my keyboard? Fixed.</p>

<p>The keys my oily, speed-typing fingers rubbed clean? <br />
Replaced.</p>

<p>The little rubber feet on the bottom of the laptop that dropped off two years ago? Replaced.</p>

<p>The trackpad and button corroded by two-and-a-half years of use in a pottery? REPLACED with new! Indeed the whole top panel is brand new.</p>

<p>This computer hasn't looked this good since Jan. 2002. </p>

<p>I should have remembered about the little right speaker being out. I knew I forgot something. But, hey I feel like I got my $300 worth. My computer works again and should last me another year at least.</p>

<p>"Let the surfing begin!" Darlene declared.</p>

	<h3>Possum update</h3>
	
	<p>It turned out that the article in the New York Times caught the attentions of the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. They threatened a lawsuit so the owner of the Brasstown gas station used roadkill instead of a live possum. They had to search all over to find one, but found a half decent one which fell at midnight. They didn't have to be nice to that one.</p>

	<h3>Computer withdrawl</h3>
	
	<p>Well, our laptop finally bit enough dust that we took it in to be repaired. The cable that lights up the screen is frayed to the point it will only light up if it is within an inch of being closed. Hard to type that way to say the least. So we'll be without our computer for the next week give or take. I still can check email at work on occasion.</p>

<p>Already we're suffering withdrawl symptoms. We have no idea what's going on in the world until the paper comes out the next day! Oh my gosh news that's more than 11 hours old! That's old news!</p>
