		<h2>03.30.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Only in Madison</h3>
	
	<p>It's been a beautiful day today. A good day for bike riding .... and bike buying. </p>

<p>Since last summer we've been saying we'd go over to <a href="www.fizzzbikeshop.com">Fizz'z Bike Shop</a> here downtown and get a bike ordered for Darlene. For fun, she added, "I hope I can get a green one."</p>

<p>Well, I stopped at Fizz'z this evening because my tires were running a few psi low. Low and behold, there was a custom bike the guys there had put together. It was her size and, of course, it was green. </p>

<p>So I dragged her over there and she took it for a spin. She loved it. She picked out a helmet (yes, we wear helmets and so should you!) and a lock for the bike. Finally, I pulled out the checkbook and -- wrong checkbook.</p>

<p>"Just take it all home and come back tomorrow and pay for it," Joey said.</p>

<p>After a short ride around town on her new bike, Darlene wheeled her bike into the pottery. "Only in Madison could I take a bike home without paying for it," she said beaming.</p>

<p>Mind you, Joey did say something to the effect of "It's OK, we know where to find you and Jerry." Ah, that oh so trusting, mafia-style acknowledgement that you live in a small town. </p>

<p>And yes, he does know where to find me. The night before, Joey had given a "bicycle into spring" workshop for the library that turned out really, really good. I had organized the program and lucked into getting really good press coverage to boot-- front page story and three photos. For once I ended up on the front page for something other than Historic Board.</p>

<p>Here's the article: <a title="Expert offers advice for safe, fun bicycling" href="http://www.madisoncourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=4&SubSectionID=253&ArticleID=23091&TM=67352.75">Expert offers advice for safe, fun bicycling</a> and <a href="http://www.madisoncourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=26&SubSectionID=813&PhotoID=11216&UID=21">another photo</a>. Yes, that's me in the background and that's my bike he's using in the program.</p>

<p>And yes, Darlene will be at Fizz'z front door at 10 a.m. tomorrow morning. Actually, she's writing out the check as I finish this.</p>

	<h3>I feel so dirty</h3>
	
	<p>When I started grad school I figured I'd never again have an opportunity to purchase affordable software so I purchased about everything that made sense. Mind you, I've been so busy I haven't had time to use any of it.</p>

<p>However, tonight I did and so help me, it put Windows XP on my wonderful Apple PowerBook G4.... aaarrrgggghhh... I feel so dirty.</p>

<p>A friend and fellow Mac user brought over some CDs that for some reason could not be read on a Mac. He couldn't read them and I couldn't read them. So for the first time, I used Virtual PC and fired up Windows XP. Low and behold, I could read the discs. </p>

<p>I use Windows at work so that wasn't a big deal, but it took me a good hour to figure out how Virtual PC worked so I find the files and burn him a new disk on the Mac side of things. </p>

<p>Maybe there's a lesson in all this. Maybe it shows that sometimes you have to compromise yourself in order to attain the greater good. Even though I may hate it, I now know I can run Windows on my laptop if it means helping a friend. Is this what it's like to co-sponsor legislation with a Republican? *wink*</p>

	<h3>The return of Billmon's Whiskey Bar</h3>
	
	<p>One of my favorite bloggers is Billmon over at the <a title="Whiskey Bar" href="http://billmon.org">Whiskey Bar</a>. He had taken a sabatical as the election wound down and we all missed his voice. Well, he's now back  and doing something rather interesting.</p>

<p>Many of his posts are just two quotes. No analysis, no opinion. Just two quotes. However, the contrast  makes the combination greater than each quote individually. It truly speaks volumes.</p>

<p>Some of my favorites have been comparing recent quotes from Bush administration officials with quotes from George Orwell's 1984. Another compared quotes from the recent Iraqi election to quotes about the 1964 Vietnamese elections. It was practically the same quote.</p>

<p>However, this recent post blew my mind. I've heard that love and hate can be close, but life and torture? Read <a title="Whiskey Bar: Christian Soldier" href="http://billmon.org/archives/001784.html">Christian Soldier</a>. How can the two thoughts go through the same mind?</p>

		<h2>03.25.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Boy am I buzzin'</h3>
	
	<p>Well, I just finished my mid-term exam in collection development and my body is buzzing. I had forgotten what it's like to come off of an adrenaline high. </p>

<p>I think I did pretty well on it. Our prof drew a graph on the board of what she expected. Along the top was short and long. On the side was airy and dense. Short and airy, as long as it answered the questions, gets a B. Short and long, odds are you end up with a few details in there, gets a B+. Short and dense with details gets an A- and long and dense with details gets an A. I think I'm on the dense side (pun intended). </p>

<p>I'd have to agree with a classmate of mine. This is our only test in the class and it's for 33% of the grade. All the assignments we've done so far this semester only equal 25% of the grade. Too many eggs in one basket there.</p>

<p>The semester is now on the downhill side, we've learned all the basics and adding the details. The key will be getting all the homework done.</p>

<p>As soon as I catch up with myself here, Darlene and I will drive straight to Lima, Ohio, to spend Easter with her family. While Darlene and her sister are filling plastic eggs for the annual Easter egg hunt, I'll go hide in the living room and do homework. But as soon as the kids show up, I'll be in the thick of it.</p>

<p>Happy Easter. To celebrate the day I want to remember what Jesus actually asked us to do in the world-- as a friend of mine said yesterday "Jesus broke the bread and fish and fed the thousands. He didn't sell them." Unfortunately, that seems to be fighting words these days.</p>

	<h3>Don't pay attention to the man behind the curtain</h3>
	
	<p>Interesting stuff coming out of Washington -- hearings over steroids in baseball and emergency legislation specifically for the parents of Terry Sorvino. </p>

<p>What are we not hearing about? Corruption in government (Tom Delay and taxpayer financed propaganda), Social Security, Medicare, the war in Iraq (yes Virginia... there's still a war going on), oil drilling in a national wildlife refuge, a federal budget that fluffs the furr of fatcats and a gawdawful bankrupcy bill.</p>

<p>Basically, the GOP has imported a fog of news to distract us because everything else polls badly. Our dog is getting wagged again.</p>

<p>If you want to see an interesting take on the daily news, check out this website that "<a href="http://www.marumushi.com/apps/newsmap/newsmap.cfm?layout=0&selected=us&categories=world,nation,business,technology,sports,entertainment,health">maps the news</a>." Rather fascinating.</p>

	<h3>Vacation all I ever wanted...</h3>
	
	<p>Just finished our five day mini-vacation. Three days of homework and two days of partying. It was a good combo.</p>

<p>Darlene and I celebrated our 15th wedding anniversary down in Louisville, Ky., the romance capital of the world for the weekend of March 19-20, 2005. I honestly don't know if that's true or not, but we certainly had fun.</p>

<p>We spent the night in a suite, took in an art exhibit, slept, slept, slept. Had really, really good fried green tomatoes, fried catfish and crab cakes (Goose Creek Diner on Goose Creek Road), did a little shopping and swam in a small hotel pool inhabited by a kick of soccer players.</p>

<p>Sunday afternoon was glorious. The first really spring-like day that we got to enjoy. We soaked up the sun on Louisville's riverfront. Walking around, playing frisee and watching in-line skaters do crazy stunts on stairs while a friend recorded it all on videotape (he was trying to create a video for his portfolio with hopes of getting into the Savannah College of Art and Design).</p>

<p>After all that getting back into the swing of studying again has been a bear. I'm not succeeding to be honest.</p>

<p>I have an open book midterm exam in my afternoon class on Friday and  I thought I'd be OK until I realized I'm going to the Indiana Library Federation annual conference on Thursday....hmmmm..... I'll just have everyone else drive and I'll read through my notes. As long as I have a general outline in my mind and have everything I need at my fingertips, I should be OK. But still, I'm pushing my luck.</p>

<p>What else is new?</p>

	<h3>Don't mess with mercury</h3>
	
	<p>Having read snippets of this article, I'll read more later, I am not amazed, but truly astounded that the Bush administration wants to roll back regulations on mercury levels. This is some of the most toxic stuff out there!</p>

<blockquote>Let�s start with a straightforward fact: Mercury is unimaginably toxic and dangerous. A single drop on a human hand can be irreversibly fatal. A single drop in a large lake can make all the fish in it unsafe to eat.</blockquote>

	<h3>Life, the universe and everything</h3>
	
	<p>"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" the movie is supposed to come out in the next month or so. I saw a preview and it looks like it'll be fun, but already I have one major, major problem with it. Ford Prefect does not have an English accent. Oh well...</p>

<p>I'm trying to get going on my major cataloging project-- full MARC records on 10 volumes of the prof's choosing. I'm getting there. I'm taking a few days off to work on the homework and to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary coming up on Sunday.</p>

<p>We got a fright from our electric company. We finally have our annex separated off on it its own meter and wiring so we had the electric company turn off the meter so the renter can put it in his own name. Well.... they turned off the electric to the building next door and it took them a day to figure out why. </p>

<p>Apparently we have always been paying their electricity bill and they have been paying ours. The kicker... they now want us to pay the difference for the past year... to the figure of.... hold onto your chairs.... $1,295.</p>

<p>It's not our fault by any stretch. Apparently, the mix up came when the attorneys who owned our building split off the electric. They mixed up the meters at some point then and it wasn't discovered until we worked on ours.</p>

<p>I was feeling guilty for not having Darlene's website updated in an eon, but was having a hard time getting my web design program working for some reason. So I chucked it all and redesigned it from scratch. Though I cheated a little bit. I used the same template I had designed for this blog and adjusted it a little for her website. So they're twins for a little while, but in the future it'll get more of it's own flavor. Check out <a hre="http://www.mudcatpottery.com">Mudcat Pottery</a>.</p>

<p>Today is the day I get my annual performance review. I hate those things, but I'll suck it up and be a good camper. Tomorrow I start my mini-homework vacation and won't have to think about work for a few days.</p>

	<h3>Otter, take 2</h3>
	
	<p>I must admit, I really enjoy otters. When I visit the zoo, otters are by and far the most enjoyable animals to observe. The Cinci Zoo has a decent-sized pond habitat for the otters. The one side is a glass wall that allows you to look underwater while they swim around. They also reintroduced the river otter to Jefferson County a couple years ago up at the Big Oaks National Wildlife Refuge.</p>

<p>So when, maybe six months ago, I saw a kids magazine go across the circ desk with otters on them, the silly pun "otter you be reading?" popped into my head.</p>

<p>Now in SLIS528 Collection Development and Management, I have to create a fictional library. I decided to have an otter as the library mascot and put the drawing on the letterhead. </p>

<p>Our most recent assignment is an intellectual freedom statement along with procedures for dealing with book challenges. The creature is also on my "materials reconsideration form." Who knows, either the otter will help defuse an argument over a book (ahh...isn't he cute?) or the person will find the drawing so darn silly that they'll try to take my head off as well as trying to take the book out of the collection. </p>

<p>My first draft, a couple entries below, looks more like a bear than an otter, so here is my second draft of the drawing...</p>

	<h3>Harry Potter book covers</h3>
	
	<p>Little by little the anticipation is cranked up another level.</p>

<p>Linked are pictures of the three covers for "Harry Pottery and the Half-Blood Prince." Bloomsbury publishes the book in Britain and the commonwealth. Scholastic published J.K. Rowling's books in the United State.</p>

<p>I like the Scholastic version the best, though I admit it may be that I'm simply partial to the color green.</p>

	<h3>Overtime and bankruptcy bills defy family values</h3>
	
	<p>You gotta give Republicans credit. They are taking full advantage of their majority status to pass legislation to their liking. Yet, the vindictiveness of these bills blows me away.</p>

<p>With two recent bills, the Republicans prove themselves the party of the corporations.</p>

<p><b>Bill one</b>: Sen. Rick Santorum is sponsoring a bill that will make overtime applicable to people working more than 80 hours in two weeks. If it passes, an employer could jack you around at will. 50 hours one week, 30 the next, 60 the following and 20 after that.</p>

<p>How is a family to figure out child care then? How will they ever attend a student play or parent-teacher conference?</p>

<p>Even if the 40-hour work week survives, overtime is over.</p>

<p><b>Bill two</b>: The second, more evil bill, will restructure bankruptcy for individuals. In essence they are eliminating the humane elements of bankruptcy law. If you drown in medical bills from an emergency hospitalization? Tough luck, live with the debt. If you are a soldier who goes to Iraq and your salary goes from $60T to $24T and your family falls into bankruptcy? Tough luck, live with it.</p>

<p>This is not "family values" folks. This is paying off the people who put the Republicans in charge.</p>

<p>Review history from 1870 to 1920 (give or take a few years). Corporations basically ruled the country unimpeded and humans were treated like pieces of a machine to be discarded when the parts broke. This may "sound" like a socialist manifesto, but it's not. It was just reality. The industrial revolution was literally built on the backs of the poor and immigrants. </p>

<p>Here are some photos from the era: <a href="http://www.historyplace.com/unitedstates/childlabor/index.html">History Place: Child Labor in America.</a></p>

<p>I doubt we'll ever return to the era of child labor, but it certainly gives you an idea of what I'm trying to say.</p>

<p>Once again, I encourage you to write to your congressmen and senators.</p>

<p>Here are a few links that explain the bills: </p>

	<h3>My day in Indy</h3>
	
	<p>My collection development professor wasn't planning on writing many comments on a draft document we turned in last Friday... that was until she saw an "it's" that should have been an "its." Seeing that the "dam broke loose," she said, and the comments were flowing. Of course, yours truly had to be one of the offenders.</p>

<p>"I'm surprised that you, having been a journalist, would make that error."<br />
"What can I say, I had copy editors."</p>

<p>Between you and me, I'm amazed my writing has been as clean as it has been lately.</p>

<p>It wasn't a beautiful afternoon, but it certainly wasn't the cold, windy Fridays of recent weeks. Thus I went for a walk and, for the first time ever, visited the Indiana State Library and the Indiana Capitol.</p>

<p>Both buildings have been recently renovated and both are absolutely beautiful and do the state proud.</p>

<p>I walked around the capitol extensively peering in at the Indiana Supreme Court and the house and senate chambers. I stood in the office where former Madison Mayor Morris Wooden sat as state auditor. I even visited the governor's office.</p>

<p>I knew the governor wasn't there. Indeed, he was here in Madison while I was there in Indianapolis.</p>

<p>Nonetheless I gave the person at the desk in his office my three cents. </p>

<p>Penny one: The governor comparing the minority Democrats, who had walked out on the legislative session, to terrorists "car-bombing" his "drive toward reform" was pretty darn tacky when our troops are in Iraq suffering from the real "car bombs." </p>

<p>Penny two: I noted that complaining about it was hypocritical when the Republicans had done the same type things to Democratic administrations. As a classmate of mine stated: "same practices, just the sides have changed."</p>

<p>Penny three: I did say that I liked the idea of daylight savings time. </p>

<p>See I can be bi-partisan.</p>

	<h3>It's tough writing briefly</h3>
	
	<p>I'm currently working on an assignment for my Collection Development class. We are to read three articles and write brief review on each. The kicker is it must fit on one sheet of paper. </p>

<p>I just finished reading a study on censorship in Australian public libraries. Very interesting stuff, but very hard to write a good review in few words when there is so much information in the study.</p>

<h4>what.</h4>
<ul><li>This is a journal of our life, culture, libraries, the Apple Macintosh, progressive politics, and of course historic Madison, Indiana, the most beautiful rivertown in America.</li></ul>

<h4>who.</h4> 

<ul><li>G'day, I'm E.G. Yarnetsky and I answer questions at our local library. I'm preparing to go to grad school in January. I'm a former journalist who still dabbles in design work. My wife's a potter who makes beautiful functional and sculptural ceramics.</li></ul>
