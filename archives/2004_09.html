	<h3>New rack cards arrived</h3>
	
	<p>My biggest grin today was seeing a project come to fruition. </p>

<p>I've been slowly working on a full-color 4"x9" rack card for Darlene. Rack cards are a great networking/marketing tool for a small town. If a tourist gets to one business and a rack card catches their eye, they'll often visit that business.</p>

<p>I've made two assumptions. 1) All the cards in town are mono-tone. If they see color, they'll react. 2) A person seeing the words Mudcat Pottery may not understand what it it. Is it paint-your-own? Do they sell ceramic supplies? However, if they see a beautiful pot in full color, again they'll react. </p>

<p>Basically, her work speaks for itself and I wanted to convey just that. Combine these thoughts and I think spending a few extra bucks for full color will result in more traffic and sales.</p>

<p>Either way, the cards arrived today and they look absolutely wonderful. If we don't get an uptick after I get these things distributed I'll eat these rack cards.</p>

<p>We worked through a company called <a href="http://www.48hourprint.com">48hourprint.com</a> that specializes in printing full color printing on both sides and makes it affordable by putting multiple jobs on the press at the same time. They call it gang printing. The big upside is you're sharing the cost with other clients and can get cheap prices. The downside is there can be variations in color on the job. I haven't looked through the whole box, but the ones on top are beautifully printing and high grade glossy stock. I'm extremely pleased with how they turned out. We bought 2,500 of them and even with shipping we spent less than $300 or about 11.7 cents each. You can hardly get a black and white photocopy for that.</p>

<p>I can't wait to get them around town. They are very classy, but they say "wow" and I can't wait to get the feedback. Yes, I admit it. I'm looking forward to an ego feeding. Darlene's pot looks awesome and the card looks awesome.</p>

	<h3>Yes, we're still alive...</h3>
	
	<p>Though for a minute I wondered if Darlene was.</p>

<p>I'm sitting here doing my evening surf and Darlene's in her glaze room working on a load. A typical evening in the Mudcat Building.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I hear yell "Shiiiittt" and then nothing. She generally only swears when it truly warrents it, that got my attention, but when I didn't hear anything I started worrying.</p>

<p>"Hon? What's up?" Nothing. "Hon?" With a little more urgency.</p>

<p>I can't remember exactly what she said, but I remember the sight.</p>

<p>She was standing there a bit wet with the sink faucet in her hand. </p>

<p>The pressure of the water had blown the faucet off the sink. We knew it was old and cheap, but she didn't expect that. </p>

<p>Thus, I understand the silence-- pure shock.</p>

<p>I tried to reset the faucet, but it didn't hold and she got wet again. Oh well. We'll buy a new one. I can't imagine how old the other one was anyhow.</p>

	<h3>If Iraq were the United States</h3>
	
	<p>This <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2004_09_01_juancole_archive.html#109582366638394688">blog entry</a> is by Juan Cole is Professor of History at the University of Michigan.</p>

<p>It certainly brings home the scale of what is going on in Iraq. Very interesting reading.</p>

<p>As the cliche goes: "If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention."</p>

		<h2>09.22.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>My evening in the children's room</h3>
	
	<p>I worked tonight instead of my usual Wednesday as the children's librarian went to a conference today.</p>

<p>I helped some high school students with a project that seemed a little too broad (just about everything under the sun dealing with the turn of the 19th to 20th century from Mother Jones to inventions). I also shelved some books. </p>

<p>I'm always amazed how many cool children's books there are in our library. I have no idea if the kids think they're cool, but I do. </p>

<p>Tonight I read easy readers about a Chinese girl celebrating the Fourth of July, a boy whose robot goes crazy when he should be in bed sleeping, a Jewish girl preparing for the sabbath dinner with her grandmother, about a young girl in Jim Crow Nashville discoving the library (the only integrated place in the city practically), and one illustrating blues lyrics.</p>

<p>The latter two books were eye reopening. Certainly, I've read about what life was like under segregation. But the living the easy life of small-town America 2004, you forget the pain that was suffered. I never realized that Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit" referred to lynchings. I never heard the lyrics.</p>

<p>After reading a children's book (a children's book!!!!), it leaves one wondering how one could ever forget.</p>

<p>"Southern trees bear strange fruit,<br />
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root,<br />
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze,<br />
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees."</p>

	<h3>Speaking of geese or ducks actually...</h3>
	
	<p>I've finally gotten enough ducks in a row for grad school-- though a few are still quacking and straggling behind. </p>

<p>Today I plunked down my $50 and submitted my application to the Indiana University School of Library and Information Science. </p>

<p>I still need to send them one of my transcripts. I ordered them, but somehow I have a bill of $106 at Bowling Green State University. I haven't the foggiest how it got there as I had transferred to Miami University with no problem. The only thing Darlene can think of is she got a parking ticket driving a car in my name. Thus, no transcript. Go figure.</p>

<p>Also I need to get my recommendations in, or rather herd my recommendations in. So far only one of people who agreed to be references has turned in their work. Another promised to finish it this week. I haven't talked to the third. It's actually a bit of work. There's about a dozen questions to answer and an essay to write (up to 5000 characters). While I joke about herding ducks, I really appreciate their willingness to do so. </p>

<p>I talked to the one gentleman who wrote me a reference. He is a retired academic library director who serves on our board. He is amazingly happy that I decided to pursue the profession and promised to be on my back until I finished the masters. I'll take the encouragement where I can get it.</p>

<p>I had known him for several years as a reporter. But, not long after I started at the library, I unknowingly helped out his father with some reference questions. He later told me that his father came home that day and really complimented the service. Ever since then he's asked me every six months or so if I was planning to pursue an MLS.</p>

<p>I suspect it goes a little further than that. Like myself, he stumbled across librarianship from another profession and found he enjoyed it. There are still so few men in the profession (I think I read 21%) that when a new one joins in, the current men rejoice?</p>

		<h2>09.21.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Just under flood stage</h3>
	
	<p>I really need to get down to see the river. I think I'll get up early to do so tomorrow. The Ohio takes on a very different look when it is high. If it wasn't for the rushing water, it would seem more like a lake. </p>

<p>It's around the 444 foot level with flood stage at 451. It's peaking now and is supposed to be down to 440 by Friday, still a bank full, but definitely no flooding.</p>

<p>Darlene said it's a mess down there. Tons of debris floating down river. She said she thought she saw a 'fridge float down. Our daily newspaper's photographer told her he thought he saw an outhouse. Lots of barrels and trees.</p>

<p>Lots of people have been down by the river watching it go by. Guys sitting at the side of the street fishing -- normally you'd have to walk *down* a good 20 feet to get to the river. Nearby, E.G. (the Egyptian goose on the riverfront, not me) was huddling with his new found cohort Aneg (ANother Egyptian Goose). All the geese were displaced to parkland across the street.</p>

<p>It seems sad that we're watching the river flow by with an odd fascination as towns in Pennsylvania, W.Virginia and North Carolina are getting swept away by the remnents of Ivan. We didn't get the rain so there is a disconnect when we watch the swollen river.</p>

	<h3>Thank God that's over with</h3>
	
	<p>Well, I did it and I survived. I took the GRE this afternoon and did well enough that I'm not embarrassed to report my scores to the Indiana University School of Library and Information Science.</p>

<p>I didn't do as well on my verbal as I had on a couple of my practice tests, but based on estimates (I'll know exact percentiles in a few weeks) I still managed to get into the top 15%.</p>

<p>The quantitative I'm happy with. I beat my practice scores and even beat the national average by 30 points. Considering my math skills had deteriorated significantly prior to studying, I'm satisfied.</p>

<p>I believe I did well on the analytic writing essays as well, but I won't learn those scores for a few weeks either.</p>

<p>I'm also happy with my scores considering I woke up at 3 a.m. and couldn't get back to sleep for Lord knows how long. (Our alarm clock was on the blitz because some guy broke in to the transformer station and <a href="http://www.madisoncourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=4&SubSectionID=253&ArticleID=20097">turned off the power to downtown</a> last night...bizarre story). Then we got off to Louisville a later than I wanted and I had to skip lunch. Fortunately, Darlene had the foresight to bring a bottle of water, a banana and a snack bag of Cheezits for me to munch on. It was just enough to get me through.</p>

<p>I sat down at the computer and, after a few minutes of mild panic, the rest of the test went fine. I'm amazed at how focused I was able to get when it counted. Mind you when I was done, the adrenaline rush came to a crash and I was nearly shaking.</p>

<p>While I was taking the test, Darlene enjoyed some shopping for the first time in an eon and bought me a very classy forest green sweater as a "congratulations for surviving" gift. We kicked back Louisville for a little bit, had seafood for dinner and walked around a bookstore and health food store (I got hooked on almond butter and that's the only place I can find it). After all that I finally was able to wind down a bit.</p>

<p>But I did it, I'm done and I'm ready to crash for the night.</p>

		<h2>09.15.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>A breathe of fresh air from Salem</h3>
	
	<p>I'm thinking the way to follow the campaign is to read the local papers in communities where the candidates appear. In the era of the Internet, this is certainly possible.</p>

<p>The local reporters don't have to listen to the candidates day after day. They are not jaded and as a result, they actually report on what's being said instead of looking for the little things to pick apart.</p>

<p>The second advantage is they understand the local issues and question the candidates on those issues.</p>

<p>Here's a decent example of an interview with John Edwards from <a title="State News - StatesmanJournal.com" href="http://news.statesmanjournal.com/article.cfm?i=86729">the Statesman-Journal</a> in Salem, Oregon.</p>

<p>I've heard the basics before, but because they took the time to ask questions, there are details here I have not read in the national news. Things that make a decent amount of sense.</p>

<p>For example, instead of capping malpractice suits at $100,000 as Bush has proposed ($100K? a life has got to be worth more than that)-- Edwards said they would propose that lawsuits be vetted by an independent body of experts before even being admitted to the courts. If it's frivilous, the buck stops. </p>

<p>I'd be interested in hearing more details, but that certainly sounds better than generically cutting off the rights of the injured.</p>

<p>[<b>Update based on a comment</b>: Good to have your comment! Mind you, you missed the point of what I was trying to say. Though I admit I probably didn't say it well enough to begin with. </p>

<p>The breathe of fresh air wasn't from Edwards, he is simply trying to get his message across. Bush stays on message extremely well, usually committing the same "sin" you mention of not answering the question. That, however, is par for the political course.</p>

<p>Rather, it's the reporter himself who is a breath of fresh air. The media has been in the "he said-she said-I'm outta here" mode of reporting for some time now. Very few reporters are asking relevant questions (as this reporter actually did). Very few are actually telling the audience whether the candidate is telling the truth, bending the truth, ignoring the truth or just out and out lying (and repeating them to make them the truth). Thus media has been doing a piss-poor job. Thus, I'm glad the reporter actually asked questions his readers cared about.</p>

<p>Finally, I agree that multi-million dollar lawsuits are a good way of driving doctors out of business. However, when you get a real quack, limiting damages to $100,000 as Bush has proposed is not right. </p>

<p>Case in point? Dr. Tom Coburn, Republican Senate candidate from Oklahoma. He admits to sterilizing underaged women. Doing this to girls who probably don't know any better is disgusting. Based on the one woman's charge, it makes me wonder how many of the others were under shady conditions. Thus $100,000 is just a slap on the wrist. If it is all true, he should be out of business. </p>

		<h2>09.14.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>The answer is 42</h3>
	
	<p>Snippets from life, the universe and everything...</p>

<p>I went with our assistant director to a couple of festivals on Saturday to talk up the library. In the afternoon we watched the longest continuous Pony Express Run in the nation run at the Canaan Fall Festival. We then spent the evening listening to a mariachi band at Fiesta Latina. [<b>update</b>: <a href="http://cards.webshots.com/cp-85868742-GChc-album/186867416ASTayc">festival photos</a>)</p>

<p>It was good to get out of the library because it's been hot as hell in there the last few days. Our contractor cut off our air conditioning to install new units and it was easily in the upper-80s in the library. I worked in it Sunday afternoon and if it wasn't for the fans we would have just died. Fortunately, they hooked it back up this afternoon so I am hoping tomorrow will be better.</p>

<p>Also, after a summer worth of probably unneccessary wrangling with computer consultants, I've chosen someone to do the wireless internet project at the library. I'm enjoying high-speed wireless at home and it'll be great to have it at the library for anyone to use. </p>

<p>Mind you, after last week, I think anyone would agree that our library is a "hot spot."</p>

<p>Darlene's got pots everywhere in her studio and is trying to get them through the kiln in time for the <a href="http://www.madisonchautauqua.com/">Madison Chautauqua</a>. She figures she'll get seven more glaze loads through which is pretty good. </p>

<p>We had a scare as her kiln couldn't make it to 2200F and shut itself down. Turns out the lid is getting a little warped and we're losing too much heat out the top. She put a brick on the lid to hold the seal and that was enough to do the trick. This evening she pulled out a very nice load of pots. Very rich glazes came out o f the kiln. Some new kiln bricks on top should do the trick.</p>

<p>Sunday morning, I felt my first earthquake ever. This one was 95 miles away, but I was just the right place to feel it-- on our third floor bathroom toilet (sigh... what timing). If I hadn't been on such a solid surface high up in an antique brick building I doubt I would have noticed. I wasn't able to confirm my assumed hallucination until that evening when I checked the <a href="http://pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/shake/STORE/Xnhad_04/ciim_display.html">earthquake</a> center website to see a 3.6 hit near Shelbyville, Indiana.</p>

<p>Studying for the GRE is oddly a nice diversion from politics. My math is improving and I think I'll be able to hit my goal of a 600 on the section (I need a minimum of 500). I'm learning that getting problems right in practice and right in a testing situation are two different things. In an untimed practice I got 52/60 questions right. On a timed test this evening I got 18/28. (To compare the two fractions, multiply the denominators and cross multiply for the numerators). I just need to make sure I write it all down. It's very easy to miss details when you're trying to rush it. Quick which is greater? The arithmatic mean of 7, 3, 5, 1 or the mean of 2a-5, 4a, 7-6a?</p>

<p>I'll find out on Friday if I've picked up enough speed and remembered all the formulas. Fortunately, I have Thursday off for last minute studying. By the way, the two are equal.</p>

		<h2>09.12.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>The ultimate flip-flop</h3>
	
	<p>In the war against terrorism, President Bush has stated: "I think you can create conditions so that those who use terror as a tool are less acceptable in parts of the world."</p>

<p>I have a question, Mr. President. Why is using terror as a tool acceptable here in this part of the world? To the point, why have you not condemned the arrival of <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0409010148sep01,1,6705318.story?coll=chi-newsnationworld-hed">terrorists</a> who landed at an airport outside Miami last month to a homecoming celebration?</p>

<p>If we as a nation really want to fight terrorism, if we as a nation really want to be the leader in this fight, we must do a few things.</p>

<p>First, we must truly cooperate with other nations. No cop goes into the streets on his or on her own. Their back is always being watched by trained and able forces. Similarly, it is ideal when the officer knows the neighborhood is also watching his back. He needs to know he can do his job without fear the neighborhood will join in on the wrong side of the fight.</p>

<p>That's is why we need cooperation from other nations. Without it, we're sitting ducks. That is why a coalition of the willing is not enough. If there is a weak link in the chainmail of our defense, the terrorists will find it. They are very mobile, very independent, can very easily take advantage of this weakness. </p>

<p>Secondly, to get that cooperation, we must listen to the wisdom of former Texas Governor George W. Bush. During the second presidential debate in 2000 he stated: "If we're an arrogant nation, they'll resent us. If we're a humble nation but strong, they'll welcome us."</p>

<p>Indeed, we must not only fight the war against terrorism, but we must also take the moral high ground. To do this we must acknowledge that "a terrorist is a terrorist is a terrorist." Not that "a terrorist is not a terrorist when he is a freedom fighter against a country whose leadership we would love to see overthrown."</p>

<p>Yes, this would make our foreign policy more difficult, but at the same time we would certainly start getting cooperation because no country could tell us we need to "practice what we preach."</p>

<p>Again, let's start here at home. How can we as a nation argue against terrorism when we let a wanted terrorist slip our grips into the wilds of Honduras? How could we let his henchmen join in a celebration outside Miami?</p>

<p>Could it be that we probably trained them to begin with? Could it be you'd rather win re-election rather than fight terrorism?</p>

<p>[<b>Update</b>: this happened a couple of weeks ago, I just read about it on <a href="http://www.dailykos.com">DailyKos.com</a>. Here are two columns from foreign policy writers. The first from the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/commentary/la-op-sweig12sep12,1,2644811.story?coll=la-sunday-commentary">LA Times</a> and the second from the <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/opinion/sfl-08forum07sep11,0,5886862.story?coll=sfla-news-opinion">South Florida Sun-Sentinel</a>.]</p>

		<h2>09.10.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Here come the guns again</h3>
	
	<p>When my father died, he was a police officer at Miami University. For the most part it was a peaceful job, but I do remember one of his cohorts being faced with a drug-crazed college student weilding a switch-blade. It could have been a lot worse.</p>

<p>With the ban on semi-automatic weapons set to expire on Monday, it is easy to imagine worse.</p>

<p>Obviously, my father owned guns and regularly practiced their use. A few times he had taken me to the shooting range. I've shot a few rounds, but it didn't really interest me. </p>

<p>My dad said the key to guns is respect and safety. You respect their power, you keep them locked up when not in use. With that in mind, I don't have a problem with gun ownership. If we ever get our building to a state of non-chaos, I could finally display an antique flintlock my father gave me.<br />
 <br />
But even with the respect for gun ownership, I still have no idea what use a semi-automatic weapon would be to anyone.</p>

<p>What do AK-47s have to do with hunting? <br />
Why do gun makers advertise their arms as <a href="http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/shooting/0424guns9.shtml">"fingerprint proof"</a>?</p>

<p>I think Kerry said it aptly <a title="The New York Times > Kerry Says Bush Assault Weapons Stance Aids Terrorists" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/10/politics/campaign/10CND-CAMP.html?hp"> today</a>...<br />
<blockquote>"Four years ago," Mr. Kerry said in St. Louis, "George Bush said he'd stand with and protect America's police officers by extending the assault-weapons ban, which keeps the most dangerous assault weapons off our streets, the same weapons that America's police officers want off our streets, not just to fight ordinary crime but to take on terrorists.</p>

<p>"In fact," the Democratic presidential candidate went on, "an Al Qaeda training manual recovered in Afghanistan included a chapter urging terrorists to get assault weapons in the United States. Why is George Bush making the job of the terrorists easier and making the job for America's police officers harder?"</blockquote></p>

<p>Yes, a terrorist can use of about anything as a weapon-- Timothy McVeigh proved that. Yet why should we make access to these weapons easy? Who benefits? I just don't get it.</p>

	<h3>Science Friday: Walking on Water</h3>
	
	<p>Like a water skimmer, here's a mini robot weighing just a gram that can walk on water. The robot was created by a Carnagie-Mellon engineer with help from some MIT folks. Here's the <a title="The New York Times > AP > Technology > Engineer Builds Robot That Walks on Water" href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/technology/AP-Water-Walking-Robot.html">article</a> from the NY Times. Interesting stuff.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I'm still studying for the GRE which is now only a week away. I'm doing math problems like crazy, but my speed is way down as I'm battling through the fog of a cold *snurf*<br />

	<h3>Buffalo: Anniversary of Wm. McKinley being shot</h3>
	
	<p>I was amazed when skimming the NYTimes that today was the anniversary of President William McKinley getting shot at the 1901 Pan American Exposition in Buffalo, NY. </p>

<p>My hometown was one of the richest and largest cities in the country and the Expo was Buffalo's coming out party-- flush with electricity that came from Niagara Falls. </p>

<p>It was a gorgous expo with Spanish influenced architecture surrounding a lake in a Olmstead designed park. Unfortunately, the buildings were built of wood lathe and plaster and they are gone. Only one expo building, the New York State Building, was designed as a keeper which is now the <a href="http://www.bechs.org/">Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society.</a></p>

<p>McKinley was speaking at the expo when an anarchist shot him. It's believed that he would have lived had the doctors not botched the surgery. Here's the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0906.html?dpc">9-6-1901 front page</a> from the New York Times.</p>

<p>Here are some good links about the expo:</p>

<p>Here are some Edison <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/papr/mckhome.html">motion pictures from the expo.</a> Neat Stuff! Especially the <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?papr:16:./temp/~ammem_9hNW::">Electric Tower</a> film taken from a hot air balloon. The water fall fountain at the base of the building is awesome.</p>

<p>Buffalo History Works: <a href="http://www.buffalohistoryworks.com/panamex/">Pan-Am Expo</a></p>

<p>A cornacopia of <a href="http://ah.bfn.org/h/panam/links.html">expo links</a><br></p>

<p>An article on the  <a href="http://ah.bfn.org/h/panam/north.html">architecture at the expo</a><br></p>

<p>There is a darn good mystery written about the time period surrounding the fair, Buffalo and the industrial advent of Niagara electricity called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385337647/qid=1094510490/sr=ka-1/ref=pd_ka_1/002-8488732-2584836">"City of Light"</a> by Lauren Belfer.</p>

	<h3>Our library's photocopier is blushing</h3>
	
	<p>Another entry from out "only at a library" collection....</p>

<p>One of our assistants was picking up stray papers near our photocopier and found the original of a cut and paste worksheet on sign language.</p>

<p>"Huh, sign language, that's cool. What in the...?" and she laughed her head off.</p>

<p>It was more than a dozen signs all dealing with sex. Use your imagination as to what signs were on the sheet. </p>

<p>No, I won't be publishing the results.</p>

	<h3>The RNC 1800 and a buried surprise</h3>
	
	<p>It's amazing that the police are holding demonstrators who blocks sidewalks for well over 24 hours without charge. This blog entry is about the demonstration outside of the makeshift jail: <a title="Daily Kos :: Free the RNC 1800!" href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2004/9/2/17920/12073">Daily Kos :: Free the RNC 1800!</a></p>

<p>It's interesting, but if you have a moment, scroll down to the comments at the end. The first half dozen comments are about a label sown into products made by a Washington state company. Very funny!</p>

	<h3>Twilight zone quality</h3>
	
	<p>Interesting week to say the least...</p>

<p>In the outside world::</p>

<p>Poor Paul Hamm is still suffering at the hands of the FIG (don't give up the gold).</p>

<p>Bush says we can't win the war on terrorism (then "flip-flops" like a fish out of water trying to explain it all).</p>

<p>I feel bad for whomever wrote the speech the Bush girls gave as they'll be living out the rest of the year in the gulag.</p>

<p>In our life::</p>

<p>I spoke before a plan commission meeting where I'm quoted as saying the word <a href="http://www.madisoncourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=4&SubSectionID=263&ArticleID=19852">"holistically" </a> before the board. I don't remember it. Though I admit I don't remember much of what I did say-- it's amazing how you quickly one can become a deer in the headlights. </p>

<p>Today, our assistant director and I attended a grant writing workshop where we were supposed to have come prepared to start working on writing a grant. There was only one problem... no one told us. It was supposed to be in the confirmation letter, but it was not. Fortunately (and unfortunately) I have 30 days to come up with a grant idea and write the proposal. I'll obviously be meeting with the director in the morning. We couldn't pull one out of the air that didn't fit our plans and I already have a grant I'm trying to administer (as well as the 2005-2007 technology plan I'm working on).</p>

<p>Darlene meanwhile has pots all over the place in the studio. Literally on every exposed surface. It's a lot of fun to watch (especially as the shelves are getting bare and we have a show coming up).</p>

<p>That's life on the river's edge.</p>

	<h3>Jon Stewart invites Bush to the show</h3>
	
	<p>I don't watch television. I can't afford cable and here in the valley I have to hold the rabbit ears to get one station.</p>

<p>However, there are times I wish I could. This ad in the NYTimes <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2004/9/1/151039/0346">inviting Dubya</a> to Comedy Central's The Daily Show is a riot. I'd love to see the results.</p>
