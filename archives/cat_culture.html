	<h3>New Music Thursday</h3>
	
	<p>I bought some new CDs for the first time in probably years. I had been promising Darlene some new jazz for a while and now that I've played a few tracks I think I chose well. Here's what I snagged from <a href="http://www.houseohits.com/hoh/index.htm">House O' Hits Records</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>"<b>Stay Loose...Jimmy Smith Sings Again</b>": This guy is great on the Hammond B3 organ. One of his better albums from the 1960s.</li>
<li>"<b>The Definitive Chet Baker</b>": So far I like his trumpet better than his vocals, but not bad when he combines the two. I bought this one on a whim.</li>
<li>"<b>Compact Jazz Lionel Hampton</b>": This is not one of the better Hampton collections, but I love him on the vibraphone. Hey it was a used CD.</li>
</ul>
The test obviously is whether she'll like them...

	<h3>Review: The Librarian</h3>
	
	<p>Sometimes a movie gets so hyped or has so many expectations that it is absolutely ruined. Yet, if you don't take them seriously they can still be a lot of fun. </p>

<p>Topping that list was Twister. The first time I saw it, I found myself repeatedly taking it apart. A year later our old downtown theatre reopened after a multi-year closure and Twister was the grand opening film. We went to help the new owners celebrate. That night was wonderful, a) because the Ohio Theatre is wonderful, but b) because I realized Twister was a funny movie. The line "I've got to go, we've got cows" will stay forever etched in my mind.</p>

<p>Well, when we heard TNT was produce an action-adventure flick called "The Librarian" everyone at our library was excited. Though I admit, most of my cohorts were interested because it starred Noah Wyle. </p>

<p>Now I haven't watched television (with occasional exceptions) for about a dozen years. We live in a 400-foot hole and we don't have cable. Thus everyone saw it before I did. People said it was cheesy, they complained the protagonist wasn't really a librarian. Heck, he never looked up an answer. </p>

<p>So, when our director brought in a video from the premier and offered me first dibs, I went into with low expectations. </p>

<p>Thank God I did because as a result I really enjoyed the movie. When you lower the bar, you can enjoy it for what it is-- a recreation of the grade-B movies. You know... The Killer Tomato that Ate Madison and their ilk. Darlene and I laughed the whole time. It was aweful, but in such a delicious fashion. Heck, I want to watch a sequel.</p>

<p>Heck, and any protagonist that can say, "but Mom, being a librarian is a pretty cool job," can't be all bad.</p>

<p>If you want to catch <a href="http://www.tnt.tv/Title/View4/0,5878,543783|5929||||~~~,00.html">The LIbrarian: Quest for the Spear</a> you can watch it on TNT tonight @ 11:45pm(ET), Sunday, Dec. 12th @ 11:45pm, Saturday, Dec. 18th @ 2pm and Sunday, Dece. 19th @ 10am.</p>

<p>Now I need to pass the video on to the next person in the library.</p>

	<h3>How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb</h3>
	
	<p>I bought U2's new CD for the library and had to get a listen to the puppy as Darlene is a big U2 fan.</p>

<p>Three things initially strike me about this album. </p>

<p>First, don't let your first listen dictate your opinion about this album. I keep wanting to go back and listen again and I'm liking it more with each listen. I later skimmed some reviews and found others had said as much.</p>

<p>Second, the music doesn't cut any new paths. Rather half the album reminded me of the music I loved in high school -- the New Wave-alt rock-MTV scene-- familiar, yet fresh. "All Because of You" makes me think Tom Petty, "City of Blinding Lights" a bit of Simple Minds.</p>

<p>Third, I've found U2 to be like reading the book then watching the movie. The movie pales in comparison. In the case of U2, their music has to be heard live to really appreciate. I heard live versions of both "Beautiful Day" and "Walk On" long before I heard the actual album. I'd pick the live version each time-- "All That You Can't Leave Behind" was over produced. </p>

<p>Most of the time I find myself liking just a couple songs from an album and being disappointed. So far I'm really enjoying half the album and I get the feeling the other half just hasn't snagged me yet. It's not on par with "The Joshua Tree," but it's good stuff.</p>

<p>Hmmm, U2's on tour next year, I wonder how much tickets will cost.</p>

	<h3>Jon Stewart invites Bush to the show</h3>
	
	<p>I don't watch television. I can't afford cable and here in the valley I have to hold the rabbit ears to get one station.</p>

<p>However, there are times I wish I could. This ad in the NYTimes <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2004/9/1/151039/0346">inviting Dubya</a> to Comedy Central's The Daily Show is a riot. I'd love to see the results.</p>

	<h3>BBC does TV right</h3>
	
	<p>Recently, surfing the Internet has been like visiting Louisville. We visit the same haunts over and over and shut ourselves off from discovering something new.</p>

<p>The last few trips to Louisville we've tried new things and it's been fun. Similarly, I decided to branch out my surfing a bit last night. </p>

<p>My favorite find was the BBC's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/doctorwho/">Doctor Who</a> website. It was awesome. I haven't been able to watch the British television show for years so the website is a welcome fix.</p>

<p>My favorite feature are their <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/doctorwho/webcasts/index.shtml">webcast episodes</a>. Think of them as twist between a comic book and a radio show. With the Real1 player, the episodes work best on a 56K modem or higher speed.</p>

<p>The BBC's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/">Cult Television</a> site covers all the favorites from the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy to the Thunderbirds. It features lots of multimedia content and feature articles.</p>

<p>The best piece of news I discovered was BBC is producing a <a href="http://www.abovethetitle.com/content/programmes/hitchhikers/hitchhikers.html">a new radio series</a> based on the Douglas Adams' book "Life, the Universe and Everything." It is scheduled for broadcast this September and October. I wonder if it will be available over the net or via shortwave? </p>

<p>Similarly, the final two books will also be created into radio shows. The entire cast will return for the three series which the notable exception of the late Peter Jones who starred as "the book."</p>

		<h2>07.07.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>The DaVinci Code</h3>
	
	<p>I finally read The Da Vinci Code during vacation after everyone and their brother told me to read it. After that kind of buzz I expected a lot so on the whole I came away a little disappointed.</p>

<p>The concepts and history interpretations he presented were rather interesting and I loved the puzzles. Yet, as literature it wasn't very good.</p>

<p>It read like a mystery novel wrapped around an academic paper. It used the "cliffhanger" device way too often, author Dan Brown didn't realistically develop the characters and the dialog seemed to exist solely as a way to convey information about his research. Overall it came off as bit sloppy to me.</p>

<p>I started reading it while we were at the Leeper Park Art Fair in South Bend. An English teacher came up and said it was one of her 10 favorite books of all time, but that she was mad at the author because she was a Christian.</p>

<p>I don't know why an English teacher would consider it one of her top 10, but I'm not surprised it made her mad. Unfortunately, the conversation ended before it really got started so I'm not sure what part of the book made her mad-- Jesus as human, the "edited" Bible, how the early church adapted and pilaged the existing religions, goddess worship, etc., etc. I guess any could do the trick.</p>

<p>It didn't really make me "mad" per se. I think part of the reason is I never took the Bible as absolute truth (though it does contain absolute truths). Like Brown, I suspect that books like the Bible don't make it through time unedited. Recent translations have made true efforts to return to the earliest copies, but where are other reports of Jesus' life? Just as Fox News bypasses news of President Bush's foibles, I suspect we're missing details of Jusus' truly astounding life.</p>

<p>That's the end of my thoughts as of now. I'm still thinking.</p>

	<h3>'Texas governor's race gets Kinky'</h3>
	
	<p>OK, I'm glad I read the newspaper. <br />
The <a title="HoustonChronicle.com - Texas governor's race gets Kinky" href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/metropolitan/2433090">Houston Chronicle</a> is reporting that author Kinky Friedman is planning to run for Texas governor as an independent in 2006.</p>

<blockquote>"There are no skeletons in my closet. They are all bleaching on a beach somewhere," he said.   

<p>You want to know Kinky's stand on gun control?  "I do not carry a gun myself, so if someone is going to shoot me, they better remember to bring their own weapon."   </p>

<p>On abortion?  "I am not pro-life, I am not pro-choice, I am pro football."</blockquote>   <br />
Do I have to wait until 2006? I could use some of this levity this year.</p>

	<h3>In the past 20 years,</h3>
	
	<p>In the past 20 years, the Republicans have brilliantly developed the method "framing" issues to steer voters in their favor. It's not much different from a reporter asking a "leading question." You bias a question with the intent of getting a specific answer. </p>

<p>While this can be a legitimate means of campaigning, it also results in a slew of misinformation or misdirection from the truth.</p>

<p>In addition to the CJR's Campaign Desk, The Annnenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania has started a new website called <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/">FactCheck.org</a> that aims to peer through this fog.</p>

<p>I haven't read through the whole site, but it appears to blow up the urban myths of campaigns. For example was Bush a "deserter" as Michael Moore claims? Was Wesley Clark a Republican? What Bush left unsaid in the State of the Union Address.</p>

<p>They also have an email service to receive the updates as soon as they're published.</p>

	<h3>Sheyl Crow is one of</h3>
	
	<p>Sheyl Crow is one of those singers where I either love or hate the song. </p>

<p>Her tunes fall into two catagories, the sad "I'm a broken woman" sorts and the "I'm in southern Cal soaking up the sun when everyone else in the world is broken and crazy." I guess those are the kinds of tunes her voice can manage.</p>

<p>In general it is the later that are my favorites. "Soak Up the Sun" and "Everyday is a Winding Road" are some of the best road tunes of the decade.</p>

<p>The rest... well there's 17 tunes and I'd have dumped five of them off the CD. Nonetheless, I bought the CD for the library collection. Grade: B.</p>

<p>It's frustrating. When there are thousands of CDs issued every year, sometimes buying greatest hits packages is the only way to get a good sampling in the collection.</p>

	<h3>"The Love Bug" Darlene and</h3>
	
	<p><b>"The Love Bug"</b> <br />
Darlene and I have recently watched several classic Disney flicks including "The Absent Minded Professor" and "The Shaggy Dog". Good stuff actually. The Love Bug mixed a good dose of automotive philosphy with 60s humor yet it never seemed forced. Buddy Hackett was great and Dean Jones was perfect as a person who was "half a man" if he wasn't racing cars.</p>

<p><b>"Charade"</b> <br />
Cary Grant and Audry Hepburn star in this thriller where you are not quite sure if Grant is a good guy or murderer, yet the two get along famously. Lots of romantic wit and suspense. Great date movie. Grade A- as Hepburn's a bit too sappy at times.</p>

<p><b>New on DVD</b><br />
Two movies that just came out in video/DVD that are really good. "Finding Nemo" and "Bend It Like Beckham."</p>

	<h3>Jimmy Buffett "Meet Me in</h3>
	
	<p><b>Jimmy Buffett</b> "Meet Me in Margaritaville." </p>

<p>This is Buffett's latest greatest hits package. There are a few good tunes I had not heard and a few mildly disappointing live versions of favorites. I liked "Feeding Frenzy" better. B-</p>

<p><br />
<b>The Mighty Lemon Drops</b> "World Without End" </p>

<p>A late 80s British band. The first half is pretty good punk pop. The second half is a bit slow. The tune "Inside Out" is great. B-</p>

<p><br />
<b>Dave Brubeck Quartet</b> "Time Out" </p>

<p>Here's an oldie but goodie jazz album I listened to as a kid and have rediscovered. The album's lead piece "Blue Rondo A La Turk" is even better than "Take Five" which became a hit. Later in an interview, Dave Brubeck said "Take Five" was never intended to be more than a wonderful, albeit glorified, drum solo. Grade A-</p>

	<h3>When I was a kid,</h3>
	
	<p>When I was a kid, this was my favorite series of mysteries. </p>

<p>I found one at a bookstore once and have been collecting them since. They're a lot of fun, good solid fluff reading now, but definitely a good read for 3-5 graders. </p>

<p>The series features three California boys who together formed an investigation agency that tackles the craziest mysteries featuring things from singing serpents and crooked cats to screaming clocks and dancing devils. </p>

<p>The mysteries are puzzles, but fair-- a sharp kid can solve them along with first investigator Jupiter Jones. </p>

<p>I love their business card. It features three question marks ??? “The question mark is the universal symbol of something unknown. We are prepared to solve any puzzle, riddle, mystery, enigma, or conundrum which may be brought to us,” Jupiter Jones explains in the first book. </p>

<p>As a reference assistant and someone who loves to encourage kids to read, these guys are my heroes.</p>

	<h3>David Wiesner - The Art</h3>
	
	<p><a href="http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/authors/wiesner/home.html">David Wiesner - The Art of Visual Storytelling.</a></p>

<p>With my sister-in-law Janie visiting, the topic turns to children's books. She's worked libraries and enjoys a good kids book. When she visited the library her first stop was the childrens' room where she grabbed a book for Darlene to read.</p>

<p>When I work down there one night a week I try to sneak a read of a picture book or two. My favorites are without a doubt by David Wiesner (whom I know is also a favorite of a few of my friends). </p>

<p>"Tuesday" is wonderful and well deserved its Caldecot Award. However, ranking right up there is his 1999 "Sector 7" which snagged a Caldecot Honor that year.</p>

<p>Inspired, I searched the web and was psyched to find his book publisher has posted a very nice website.  They include enlargements of several of his drawings and an excellent article about the "creative process" behind "Tuesday" from the rough concepts and storyboards to his research and final paintings.</p>

<p>Definitely worth a visit.</p>

Star Trek: New Frontier "Gods Above"<br />
New Frontier is a great series that is independent from all the tv shows. Author Peter David has created a set of characters that are simply wonderful. Deep and very funny. Start with book one and work your way through.</p>

<p><b>Tech I'm playing with</b><br />
I just got my wireless Internet up and running. No more hooking a phone cord into my laptop. I can now surf anywhere in our building. When I helped a local denist with his Macs he gave me the base station for free ($200 value-wow). Today I bought the card for the laptop. It works great.</p>

<p>Also, I'm playing with an rss/xml news reader. interesting.</p>

<p>Spent the day in Louisville shopping for clothes. I'm set for fall, Darlene's still looking for shirts. It was nice to get out of town.</p>

<h4>what.</h4>
<ul><li>This is a journal of our life, culture, libraries, the Apple Macintosh, progressive politics, and of course historic Madison, Indiana, the most beautiful rivertown in America.</li></ul>

<h4>who.</h4> 

<ul><li>G'day, I'm E.G. Yarnetsky and I answer questions at our local library. I'm preparing to go to grad school in January. I'm a former journalist who still dabbles in design work. My wife's a potter who makes beautiful functional and sculptural ceramics.</li></ul>
