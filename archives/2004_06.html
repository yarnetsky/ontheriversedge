	<h3>It's show time</h3>
	
	<p>This is the first fine arts festival of the year for us. Actually, I think it's the first show we've done in nine months or so. We've been busy setting up our studio the whole time.</p>

<p>For anyone in Northern Indiana, <a href="http://www.mudcatpottery.com">Mudcat Pottery</a> will be at the <a href="http://leeperparkartfair.org/">Leeper Park Art Fair</a> in South Bend. It's a really nice show in a nice park along the St. Joseph River.</p>

<p>The pots are being packed as I type and we'll be heading for the northern tier this afternoon.</p>

	<h3>Bush endorses condoms?</h3>
	
	<p>Candidates say amazing things during an election year, but who would have guessed that George W. would mention the word <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/24/politics/campaign/24bush.html?pagewanted=all&position=">condoms</a>?</p>

<blockquote>"We can learn from the experiences of other countries when it comes to a good program to prevent the spread of AIDS, like the nation of Uganda," Mr. Bush said. "They've started what they call the A.B.C. approach to prevention of this deadly disease. That stands for: Abstain, be faithful in marriage, and, when appropriate, use condoms." The approach was working and was a "practical, balanced and moral message," Mr. Bush said.</blockquote>

<p>This may be the first time in a couple of years that I automatically agree with Bush. Yet, I'm still skeptical. </p>

<p>According to the New York Times article Bush has pledged $15 million over five year to the cause of fighting AIDS, yet the administration doesn't seem to as aggressive as that number would suggest. They're holding back on exporting cheaper generic drugs that could make a huge difference and while the number of condoms going overseas from the U.S. is topping 400 million, the number needed is closer to 10 billion.</p>

<p>Yet, the fact Bush said the "c-word" and acknoledged a scientific approach to any problem is pretty amazing, especially considering he was talking before a church group.</p>

<p>But for now I'll wait for action (and admittedly hope that it's Kerry implementing the program). </p>

<p>Abstanance and fidelity are the best ways to avoid STDs and AIDS. But when you're dealing with an epidemic millions of people and deaths in size, you need to immediately stem its spread, then we can worry about teaching the "moral" behavior (though there's no reason they can't be done simultaneously).</p>

<p>I think the reason I'm skeptical that "saying" condoms will result in a more progressive AIDS strategy is the administration is not using the same approach with respect to birth control. In Africa, we have a population boom in a region that cannot sustain the numbers, yet the conservatives don't want to fund birth control. They just want to preach. </p>

<p>So tell me. Why can't we do both? Why are we inviting disasters?</p>

	<h3>SpaceShipOne</h3>
	
	<p>After reading about politics for one too many days, today's news that SpaceShipOne succeeded in becoming the first non-governmental flight into space was wonderful. <a title="Wired News: Private Space Shot a Success" href="http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,63924,00.html">Wired News</a> has a good story on the event. It's obvious the pilot had way too much fun... <br />
</blockquote>"I did something that nobody was aware I was going to do," he said. "When I got to apogee ... I reached into my pocket and I took out some candy-covered chocolates, all different colors, and I let 'em go in front of my face. And they just spun around like sparkling things. And I was so blown away that I couldn't fly the airplane."</blockquote><br />
I remember having a membership or reservation card for PanAm's first trip to the moon. The card, which had a futuristic painting of a "space clipper", was one of my prized possessions. It's obvious PanAm didn't last long enough to fulfill it's reservation list, but it's nice to see private enterprise taking a step in the right direction.</p>

	<h3>Majority tyranny</h3>
	
	<p>Thinking about it more, I believe all groups should be politically active. That's the freedom we have. Organizations need to be able to flex the power of numbers.</p>

<p>I think what I fear is majority tyranny.</p>

<p>For example, the Republicans as the majority in the house have literally created and passed legislation without as much as a word from Democrats in the process.</p>

<p>Then, when the Democrats try to slow down the process to get their two cents into the dollar being created, the Republicans hollar that the Democrats are trying to subvert the majority will. This is amplified by the Republicans' mantra of treason everytime someone disagrees with them.</p>

<p>Frustrating, no?</p>

<p>Conservatives by definition want to keep things they way they were (or for the cynical, keep things the way they thought they were). Yet, for better or worse, our country is changing. It's multi-cultural and multi-religious and soon the "white man" will become a minority.</p>

<p>In this kind of setting, majority tyranny is simply not a "good thing."</p>

<p>What does this have to do with church-state separation? Basically, a poltical party can bring with it a specific brand of religion that in turn can impinge on the freedom of other practices.</p>

<p>As Thomas Jefferson wrote, "We hold these truths to be self evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."</p>

<p>It's hard to have the liberty to say your peace or to pursue one's version of happiness, beit worshipping Christ, Allah or money when one group has the handle on every control and drop-kicks anyone who wants to suggest the boat is capsizing.</p>

<p>To me this freedom needs to be spread around more than it is. Both to where Christians seeking power can exercise their beliefs in freedom and so those who don't have the same beliefs can have the same freedoms.</p>

<p>Schools need to be open to folks who practice their religion. Christian groups wants to meet after school on school property? So be it. Voluntary meetings around the flag pole for a prayer before school? Go for it. If a teacher wants to join in, fine.</p>

<p>The key is that their practices should not impinge on the freedom of others to do the same. Thus the same teacher at the pole before school should not be leading the prayer in homeroom.</p>

<p>It's not a matter of political correctness or "special rules" for minorities. Rather, it's following the spirit of that Declaration, of following the Golden Rule and simply respecting your fellow human beings. Everyone should be made comfortable and welcomed as who they are.</p>

<p>Thus, the majority can run the government, but they shouldn't "rule" the country. That went out with King George III.</p>

	<h3>Bishops to campaign for Bush?</h3>
	
	<p>Frequent church-goers more often vote Republican and there is no surprise that Bush is aiming to take advantage of this demographic.</p>

<p>However, I am amazed at the depth at which Bush and the Republicans are attempting to narrow the separation of church and state to tilt the equation in their favor.</p>

<p>Two articles of interest.</p>

<p>The Washington Post reports that the house Republicans inserted a rider in the latest fast-track "jobs" bill that would <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26244-2004Jun8.html">allow pastors more freedom to engage in political activism</a> without their churches losing their tax-exempt status.</p>

<p>The article also notes a Bush campaign email that the campaign is looking to identify 1,600 "friendly congregations" in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Penalties for code violations would also be dialed down with the first violation being only a week's worth of taxes. That's pretty cheap political advertising.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <i>National Catholic Reporter</i> Vatican correspondent John L. Allen Jr. <a href="http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/word/">wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>During his visit, Bush asked the Vatican to push the American Catholic bishops to be more aggressive politically on family and life issues.... A Vatican official told NCR June 9 that in his meeting with Cardinal Angelo Sodano and other Vatican officials, Bush said, “Not all  the American bishops are with me” on the cultural issues. The implication was that he hoped the Vatican would nudge them toward more explicit  activism.</blockquote>

<p>I have hard time believing that 44 years ago people were worried that the Vatican would run a Kennedy White House. Now we apparently have Bush asking the Vatican to help him run his campaign for the White House.</p>

<p>I hope to have more thoughts on this tomorrow...</p>

		<h2>06.11.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>A slew of CDs on our doorstep</h3>
	
	<p>A paraphrased conversation at the Madison-Jefferson County Public Library this afternoon:</p>

<p>"Did you order a bunch of CDs?"<br />
"Just that order for 15 the other day."<br />
"So you didn't order 257"<br />
"Err, no."</p>

<p>After a heartbeat I remembered about the CD Settlement.</p>

<p>Last year, the top CD distributers and retailers agreed to  <a title="Wired News: Few Takers for CD Settlement Cash" href="http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,57111,00.html">pay out more than $140 million in cash and CDs</a> to settle a lawsuit that charged they fixing music prices.</p>

<p>As part of the deal, libraries would get a chunk of the proceeds. I expected maybe a couple dozen not couple dozen-dozen in six boxes.</p>

<p>The titles cover the whole spectrum of music, many of which are out of print cast offs. Others though are pretty cool. </p>

<p>I was pleased to see some jazz with Lionel Hampton and Thelonious Monk. The pop selection was so-so. Who really wants two CDs from 98 Degrees?</p>

<p>Some of them we got two and three copies of such as Atlantic Records 50th Anniversary set.</p>

<p>Last-- and probably least -- there was the "Martha Stewart's Living: Spooky and Scary Sounds for Halloween." Well, we do have a sound effects category, but I certainly would not have ordered it myself.</p>

<p>Our cataloger was obviously floored. I promised to go through them and only have her do a couple dozen at a time.</p>

<p>While I wouldn't have bought half of them on my own, it will certainly have an impact on our collection.</p>

<p>It'd be tempting not to buy another CD this year and roll the music money over into our budding, but hot DVD collection. But I can't let the siren call from Norah Jones go unanswered.</p>

		<h2>06.09.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Reagan</h3>
	
	<p>Everyone's flag is at half mast for the death of former President Reagan. While I disagreed with much of his politics, I bow my head in respect for the man. May he rest in peace.</p>

<p>Similarly may Nancy find peace that his life is certainly regarded as legendary. More so, I hope she succeeds in energizing the stem cell research that could have helped her husband.</p>

<p>As far as Reagan's legacy, I see it as mixed. On one hand he presented America as optimistic and able. In this alone, he was pretty amazing. He also was smart in his dealings with the Soviet Union. While many attribute this to a beefed up military, I think it was more likely his interactions with Gorbachev that did the trick.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he handed down a set of foreign policy experts to Bush 46 who landed him in this Iraq mess. It's little wonder as many were also involved in the Iran-Contra scandal and the atrosities in central America.</p>

<p>He wasn't most popular president in modern history (he's in the middle of the pack with Clinton), but he is certainly a legend. His style crystalized a vision in Republicans' mind of how the presidency should be.</p>

<p>What's odd is while Kerry gave a very respectful speach about Reagan at the University of Toledo and suspended campaigning until after the state funeral, Bush is using his death as campaign fodder. Check out his campaign website which has literally been <a href="http://www.georgewbush.com/">transformed.</a></p>

<p>I find it overdone, but considering how bad of shape Bush is in, you can't blame him for trying to see if some of Reagan's shine can rub off on him.</p>

		<h2>06.05.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Buying a car and John Kerry</h3>
	
	<p>Sometime this year we'll probably buy a used vehicle. Doing a little research into the matter has led me to believe that may be a frustrating experience.</p>

<p>Indeed, I'm starting to empathize a bit with John Kerry. The GOoPers wailed on him for saying he didn't own an SUV, but that his family did. I'm actually starting to think I know how he feels.</p>

<p>We own two vehicles-- a minivan that definitely needs replaced and an ugly red Ford cargo van that we use to go to fine art festivals. </p>

<p>I'm extremely jealous of the jewelers who can shove their wares and display into a small station wagon. We, on the other hand, have at least 222 cubic feet of pots to haul in a van that gets 10 mpg in the city and 15 on the highway.</p>

<p>I hate burning that much fuel to begin with, but it's outright painful at $2 a gallon.</p>

<p>We'll probably keep the big van for shows, but something smaller for day-to-day use and taking pots to galleries.</p>

<p>I'd like to get a station wagon that gets decent gas mileage.<br />
But Darlene, on the other hand, likes being able to get up off the road and see what's going on around her.</p>

<p>I can see her point of view. When I first started driving in my 76 Chevy Vega, I had a pretty good view of the road. Within the past 10 years it seems everyone has purchased an SUV or some other assorted monster truck. Now in order to get the same view of the road, you almost have to buy a monster yourself. It's a mean cycle. </p>

<p>Indeed, a couple of times recently we've driven borrowed or rented compact cars and the sight from down below is scary. Not only does it suddenly feel odd  to have my butt inches from the ground, but it's scary to see the hubcaps of an SUVs roaring by. Hmmm, what chance does this Chevy Prism have against the Ford Expedition next to me?</p>

<p>Mind you, there are cars coming out that suit both of our purposes. The Pontiac Vibe rides higher, has a bit of cargo space and gets decent mileage. Some of the smaller SUVs like the Santa Fe do OK in the mileage category as well. But alas, we don't have $20,000 to buy either.</p>

<p>So we're back to square one. Either I have to suffice with 18 city/24 highway (admittedly better than 10/15) or Darlene has to sit closer to the ground while she's driving.</p>

<p>I think I've lost this bet and we're looking at another minivan. At least we'll be using the cargo space on a regular basis unlike many SUV drivers who occupy maybe 10% of the vehicle.</p>

<p>Nonetheless I understand how John Kerry feels. I'm sure he'd love to drive a Prius, but his family wants to see the road. Obviously, he didn't win his bet either.</p>

		<h2>06.04.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>I'm either growing older ...</h3>
	
	<p>or I'm doing the wrong stretches before riding my bike.</p>

<p>When I press down on the peddles my knee tendons suddenly hurt. Putting the bike into a lower gear helps take the pressure off, but I'm sure I'm doing something wrong. </p>

<p>I think part of the problem is I stand a lot at the circulation desk and I'm letting my knees lock. Then when I bend down it's snap, crackle and pop. My shoes are comfortable, but I suspect they're not padded enough to be nice to my knees.</p>

<p>Thus, I need to find out what to do about my knees.</p>

<p>I suspect it's in the category of "doctor, heal thyself" but rather "reference assistant, stop complaining and look it up."</p>

	<h3>An interstitial message and back to work</h3>
	
	<p>Darlene and I took a mostly unexpected trip to Buffalo, New York, a couple weeks ago. My mom's husband died (my step-father) and we attended the memorial service and kept my mom company for a couple of days.</p>

<p>His son wrote a very nice piece for the service bulletin. When I get a change I'll post it and let you see the kind of man he was. I wish I had it to post before he died, but that's the nature of things I guess.</p>

<p>Either way, we've been playing catch up for a while and this blog has been on the back burner. For that I've felt a little guilty, but looking at the site statistics amplified that feeling.</p>

<p>I was originally checking the web statistics for my wife's <a href="http://www.mudcatpottery.com">website</a> to see if people were finding her pottery (it's getting there).</p>

<p>Then, out of curiosity (the reason I do most things) I checked my own stats. I only check it about once or twice a season as the statistics application was slow to use on a dial-up connection. </p>

<p>First I was surprised by the program. My host, <a href="http://www.1and1.com">1and1.com</a>, has really streamlined its control panel and now it just flies! Nice job guys. I got in on their free three-year deal, but if I had to renew today I definitely would.</p>

<p>Secondly, I thought traffic would drop if I stopped updating it on a regular basis. That apparently is not the case. Instead traffic is still climbing. In May, the site landed nearly 3000 "unique visitors."</p>

<p>Thus I feel a little guilty. When I visit my favorite blogs I expect new stuff to read. If traffic was going down I wouldn't feel guilty as there'd be fewer folks to disappoint. (Now that that's written it makes no sense).</p>

<p>Whatever, I guess I should get writing again.</p>

<h4>what.</h4>
<ul><li>This is a journal of our life, culture, libraries, the Apple Macintosh, progressive politics, and of course historic Madison, Indiana, the most beautiful rivertown in America.</li></ul>

<h4>who.</h4> 

<ul><li>G'day, I'm E.G. Yarnetsky and I answer questions at our local library. I'm preparing to go to grad school in January. I'm a former journalist who still dabbles in design work. My wife's a potter who makes beautiful functional and sculptural ceramics.</li></ul>
