	<h3>How does blogging impact web accessibility?</h3>
	
	<p>Right now I'm taking "Resources and Technology for Patrons with Special Needs" and I'm doing research for a 20 page paper (20 pages maximum thank God).</p>

<p>I write this and Darlene, reading over my shoulder, says "Ha! Knowing you, you'll have a hard time keeping it to 20 pages." I'm glad she's optimistic.</p>

<p>Either way, I'm opening this to the wisdom of the masses. </p>

<p>My topic is how does blogging (and content management software in general) impact accessibility of the resulting websites? Is the software itself user-friendly to bloggers (or would-be bloggers) who have sight impairments? What can we do to improve the situation?</p>

<p>While much of designing blogs for accessibility echoes accessible web design in general, there are other things that are unique to blogging software. For example, in order to post comments on some sites, you have to type in the distorted letters seen in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">captcha illustration</a>. That'd be impossible for someone using a screen reader. </p>

<p>In the case of <a href="http://www.blogger.com">blogger.com</a>, you have to type in the captcha before you can even get a blog. Understandable? Yes, as it keeps computers from signing up for millions of blogs. Accessible? No. How can a person who is blind blog when they can't get a blog from Blogger?</p>

<p>That's one example. Right now I'm harvesting articles for my research. If any of you have any ideas on avenues of exploration, etc., let me know... </p>

	<h3>*whew*</h3>
	
	<p>I don't think I have EVER done that much homework in such a short time. I was told summer sessions were intense, but I never expected this.</p>

<p>In the last week of my class I gave a 7-minute presentation, wrote a 6-page report, a 10-page journal, a group project on budgeting and evaluations of my teammates and myself. I did classwork from Friday-Monday basically non-stop. </p>

<p>Nonetheless I survived and I'm on vacation until Monday.</p>

<p>Even though I'm exhausted, I was suffering cabin fever and my mom is in town so we took off and partied a little in Louisville -- Carmichael's Books, Half-Price Books and a really cook new pottery gallery/supply shop at 1806 Frankfort Ave. With that break I now feel like I'm done.</p>

<p>We'll hang out around town for a couple of days and then take off for Chicago for the American Library Association annual conference on Saturday. We're planning on going to "The Stacks" the exhibition portion of the conference which I hear is quite an experience. I'm looking forward to visiting the new Graphic Novel section as I'm definitely a comics addict (I think I'm up to 65 strips a day-- a hard habit it is).</p>

<p>Wow... vacation. I might even have time to blog.</p>

	<h3>It's official</h3>
	
	<p>I finally got my official grades and I got a pair of As to start off my grad school career. </p>

<p>When I first started thinking about grad school everyone told me I'd do fine. Yet when I read the grading scale I admit I was intimidated. I knew I'd get better than a B, but I never imagined As. I guess I need to stop underestimating myself. ey?<br />
     <br />
<blockquote><br />
A (4.0)         Outstanding achievement.  Student performance demonstrates full command of the course materials and evidences a high level of originality and/or creativity that far surpasses course expectations.  The grade of A+ is not granted in SLIS, except in very exceptional cases.</p>

<p>A- (3.7)        Excellent achievement.  Student performance demonstrates thorough knowledge of course materials and exceeds course expectations by completing all requirements in a superior manner.</p>

<p>B+ (3.3.)      Very good work.  Student performance demonstrates above-average comprehension of the course materials and exceeds course expectations on all tasks as defined in the course syllabus.</p>

<p>B (3.0)         Good work. Student performance meets designated course expectations, demonstrates understanding of the course materials, and performs at an acceptable level.<br />

	<h3>*whew* I'm done. Two week break coming up.</h3>
	
	<p>We'll as of 3:30 p.m. today I was done with the first semester of grad school. Six credits down, 30 credits to go. I turned in my two final projects. I think I did a good job on them. </p>

<p>When I left my last class, I almost would have gone as far as saying I'm not sure what I'd do with myself not having homework hanging over my head for the next two weeks.</p>

<p>Actually, I'll have plenty on my agenda.</p>

<p>This weekend and next my wonderful "muddy" wife is having her pottery studio spring open house. Check the details over at <a href="http://www.mudcatpottery.com">Mudcat Pottery</a>. Yes, I used the same template I created for this website. That may be one of the things I do over break is get some new stuff up on her site and tweak it to give it more of its own personality. I also hope to read a novel or two. There are a couple new mysteries by William Tapply and Tim Cockey I've shelved in the new book section that I'd love to get my hands on. Maybe add a movie or two and some Star Trek.</p>

<p>Of course, our building needs a good cleaning from top to bottom -- I have a month worth of junk on my bedside table that I really need to go through.</p>

<p>I'll finally also have time to play with my computer a bit. My copy of Mac OS X 10.4 "Tiger" arrived in the mail this afternoon and I'm backing up all the files from my computer as I type. I'll install it tomorrow and see if it is as good as people are reporting. There is a rather interesting review on the operating system over at <a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/macosx-10.4.ars">ArsTechnica</a> that delves into every technical detail you could imagine. </p>

<p>Finally, I read the headlines that our state government finally approved Daylight Saving Time for 2006. Now we move the battle to whether we'll be in Eastern or Central time. I'm hoping we'll get to stay in Eastern time, at least in our neck of the woods as I would really hate having it get dark at 4 p.m. in the middle of winter.</p>

<p>That's all the news for Friday, 29 April 2005 (except that the movie version of "Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy" finally opened). Don't Panic.</p>

		<h2>03.25.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Boy am I buzzin'</h3>
	
	<p>Well, I just finished my mid-term exam in collection development and my body is buzzing. I had forgotten what it's like to come off of an adrenaline high. </p>

<p>I think I did pretty well on it. Our prof drew a graph on the board of what she expected. Along the top was short and long. On the side was airy and dense. Short and airy, as long as it answered the questions, gets a B. Short and long, odds are you end up with a few details in there, gets a B+. Short and dense with details gets an A- and long and dense with details gets an A. I think I'm on the dense side (pun intended). </p>

<p>I'd have to agree with a classmate of mine. This is our only test in the class and it's for 33% of the grade. All the assignments we've done so far this semester only equal 25% of the grade. Too many eggs in one basket there.</p>

<p>The semester is now on the downhill side, we've learned all the basics and adding the details. The key will be getting all the homework done.</p>

<p>As soon as I catch up with myself here, Darlene and I will drive straight to Lima, Ohio, to spend Easter with her family. While Darlene and her sister are filling plastic eggs for the annual Easter egg hunt, I'll go hide in the living room and do homework. But as soon as the kids show up, I'll be in the thick of it.</p>

<p>Happy Easter. To celebrate the day I want to remember what Jesus actually asked us to do in the world-- as a friend of mine said yesterday "Jesus broke the bread and fish and fed the thousands. He didn't sell them." Unfortunately, that seems to be fighting words these days.</p>

		<h2>03.04.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>My day in Indy</h3>
	
	<p>My collection development professor wasn't planning on writing many comments on a draft document we turned in last Friday... that was until she saw an "it's" that should have been an "its." Seeing that the "dam broke loose," she said, and the comments were flowing. Of course, yours truly had to be one of the offenders.</p>

<p>"I'm surprised that you, having been a journalist, would make that error."<br />
"What can I say, I had copy editors."</p>

<p>Between you and me, I'm amazed my writing has been as clean as it has been lately.</p>

<p>It wasn't a beautiful afternoon, but it certainly wasn't the cold, windy Fridays of recent weeks. Thus I went for a walk and, for the first time ever, visited the Indiana State Library and the Indiana Capitol.</p>

<p>Both buildings have been recently renovated and both are absolutely beautiful and do the state proud.</p>

<p>I walked around the capitol extensively peering in at the Indiana Supreme Court and the house and senate chambers. I stood in the office where former Madison Mayor Morris Wooden sat as state auditor. I even visited the governor's office.</p>

<p>I knew the governor wasn't there. Indeed, he was here in Madison while I was there in Indianapolis.</p>

<p>Nonetheless I gave the person at the desk in his office my three cents. </p>

<p>Penny one: The governor comparing the minority Democrats, who had walked out on the legislative session, to terrorists "car-bombing" his "drive toward reform" was pretty darn tacky when our troops are in Iraq suffering from the real "car bombs." </p>

<p>Penny two: I noted that complaining about it was hypocritical when the Republicans had done the same type things to Democratic administrations. As a classmate of mine stated: "same practices, just the sides have changed."</p>

<p>Penny three: I did say that I liked the idea of daylight savings time. </p>

<p>See I can be bi-partisan.</p>

	<h3>It's tough writing briefly</h3>
	
	<p>I'm currently working on an assignment for my Collection Development class. We are to read three articles and write brief review on each. The kicker is it must fit on one sheet of paper. </p>

<p>I just finished reading a study on censorship in Australian public libraries. Very interesting stuff, but very hard to write a good review in few words when there is so much information in the study.</p>

		<h2>02.20.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Snippets for Sunday</h3>
	
	<p><b>Friday was a good day on campus.</b> We finally had a sunny afternoon. Not a cloud in the sky so I took advantage of my lunch break to go for a nice long walk down to the White River and back talking to Darlene on the cell phone until my shoulders got sore (I should have locked my backpack in the library lockers). The campus is pretty barren now, but I'm starting to see the trees. It should be rather pretty come spring.</p>

<p><b>grades</b>: I finally received my first graded assignments back in both classes. It felt really, really good to see "excellent work" and "outstanding" on my first papers. </p>

<p>I have to admit that the concept of graduate school had terrified me. Last summer while I was studying for the GRE, a librarian I know said "Jerry, it's just library school, you'll be fine." OK, now that I'm doing the work I can agree with the statement.</p>

<p><b>Coursework</b>: In cataloging we are moving on to MARC records. I thought I was drowning in rules before. Now I'm really drowning in rules. It'll click in I'm sure.</p>

<p>In collection development we are building a collection development plan and related policies step by step. Those policies should reflect the library and the community it serves. Thus the first step is to create a fictional library and community-- fictional, though connected to reality. This is the fun part. I remember covering the Talawanda schools in Oxford, Ohio, when I worked as a reporter for the public radio station at Miami University. You have the college profs wanting a high-end education for their kids, but the farmers outside of town were paying the lion's share of the property taxes. They definitely butted heads a bit during board meetings. So...how would a library operate in similar circumstances? Thus my fictional library will echo that dicotomy.</p>

<p><b>Speaking of fictional</b>: It amazes me that we still haven't screamed bloody murder that the White House has systematically created propoganda for domestic consumption. The fake newscasts played as real news, the columnists paid to write "real" opinion, federal agencies hawking political agenda and now "Jeff Gannon" a fake reporter asking fake questions in White House press conferences so real reporters are being thrown off track. If this was the Clinton White House the Republicans would have set up five investigations by now. Sheesh. Propoganda simply has no place in our society. If the president has something to say, let him say it loud and clear and be answerable to the press and the public. They are pushing fear and hiding behind fake newstories. It's unethical at best.</p>

<p>grrrrrr [imagine a dog taking the Bush action figure by the collar of his flight suit and shaking it back and forth]</p>

<p><b>From the mouths of kids</b>: There is a six-year-old patron of ours that floors me. I told him about the Danny Dunn series of books, which was one of my favorites at his age. He's been swallowing them whole and sent me a thank you note. A THANK YOU NOTE without as much as a word from his parents. Amazing. Now he won't let anyone else check out his books if I'm on the desk. The last time he checked out a video and some books. The due date on the video was Feb. 23 and the books were due on March 2 so I told him about how the numbers were opposite 2-3 and 3-2. He backed up as in shock and said "Wow, that's a palindrome!" A six-year-old knows what a palindrome is? I can understand him knowing the Latin names for all the dinosaurs but palindromes too?</p>

	<h3>One grade in</h3>
	
	<p>I received my first grade of grad school. It was only an exercise worth a 1/10 of my final grade, but it was graded nonetheless. The exercise was in my bibliographic access and control class-- questions about definitions we needed to know and transcribing features from title pages into the proper format for bibliographic records. </p>

<p>FWIW I got a 9.9 out of 10 -- 90 more points to go. Back to work, I'm working on the follow-up exercise now.</p>

		<h2>01.28.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Grad school week three</h3>
	
	<p>My cataloging class is now delving into the book description details of the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules. The professor this morning went over practically each rule. This was the stuff I was having trouble getting through as I was reading so I thanked her for the review.</p>

<p>Her response? "There's no way I could tell everyone just to read chapters one and two without reviewing it. It doesn't make any sense." Thank God I'm not the only one.</p>

<p>Actually, once it's all explained it does make sense. I've learned enough that I could now create a catalog card using the International Standard Bibliographic Description for a pretty straight forward book. Details relating to the cataloging of books are coming next week.</p>

<p>Doing MARC (machine readable catalog) records and subject terms could be another story. Our final project is to create full MARC records on 10 books of her chosing. I spent a couple hours photo copying title pages and preliminaries and tech reading the volumes this afternoon. I'll dive into them over the next few weeks.</p>

<p>My collection development professor is giving a talk in Richmond commemorating the final segregated American Libraries Association meeting. After the experience in 1936, the ALA swore never to hold another convention in a segregated city again. Definitely ahead of the curve.</p>

<p>Either way, because of that she taped her lecture so I'll listen to it tomorrow morning. The video will probably be minimal as it is intended to be viewable over a 56K modem.</p>

<p>When you drive four hours in a day you have plenty of thoughts<br />
--<b>Iraq</b>: Old news to anyone paying attention, but I have to agree with Sy Hersh, we're not really fighting insurgents. We're still fighting Sadam Hussain's guys-- didn't it strike you that we "won" Bagdad a little too easy?<br />
--<b>No on Gonzalez</b>: Any attorney who believes the president should be able to break or ignore whatever law he feels is wrong has no business being in the Justice Department. Someone who in essence condones torture has no right being attorney general.<br />
--<b>bad jokes</b>: During the first week of classes I heard someone pronounce SLIS (school of library and information sciences) for the first time. I had always said it S.L.I.S. (like A.L.A. and F.B.I.). She pronounced it "sliss." I said it was awful, but the first thing that popped in my head was a bad joke. "What do you call a female library sciences student? Slis Miss." Today, I saw her again and she told me she told the joke to several of her friends who had a good laugh. Go figure.<br />
--<b>Podcasting</b>: Could podcasting could bring broadcasting to the masses. A friend-fellow librarian, blogged out, has now started podcasting.<br />
--<b>Apple</b>: Pages sounds pretty cool, but v1.0 quirky. iPod shuffles at Wal-Mart? Yuck!<br />
--<b>Sunrises</b>: No wonder farmers want to get out at the crack of dawn. Hoosier sunrises, when the clouds are just right, are downright beautiful. Pinks, oranges and blues bubbling over horizon. I was a challenge to keep my eyes on the road.</p>

<p>There's more, but it's time to sleep. We left at 6:45 and got home at 9:15 p.m. Boy what a long day (it could have been shorter, but we got lost in what one nurse at University Hospital calls the "gerbil tubes".)</p>

		<h2>01.22.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Friday at grad school #2</h3>
	
	<p>Boy yesterday was a long day. I walked out the door at 6:30 a.m. and walked back in at 7:30 p.m. I didn't do much of anything other than attend classes and drive. Let me tell you, my back didn't like that one bit. I then slept 11-1/2 hours.</p>

<p>I'm about as good as new this morning. While, I've been goofing off reading computer stuff this morning, I need to get reading for class. I need to review the book cataloging rules under the AACR2 (Anglo-American Cataloging Rules) for the next class and read a bunch of journal articles for Collection Development.</p>

<p>My new "toys" helped make yesterday seem shorter. As much as I hate the cell phone, being able to talk to Darlene between classes helped immensly. I listened to my iPod during the drive. Music on the way up (Michelle Shock's "Arkansas Traveler" is a great album) and an audio book on the way home (a collection of Poirot short stories). </p>

<p>The classes themselves went well. The morning class is a quiet one. Maybe everyone's not awake yet. Cataloging is like learning a computer language. There's a lot of picky stuff like making sure you have the proper punctuation in the proper spots. It makes me think of CSS. If you have a semi-colon out of place the whole webpage can break down. </p>

<p>[Darlene just saw a webpoll on CNN.com that asked whether Bush will achieve his second-term goals. It was a simple yes and no question. Darlene says the poll needs a third option. "How about 'over my dead body'?"]</p>

<p>The collection development class should be a challenge. The professor likes that the SLIS grading system where to get an A you have to do things so creative and beyond expectations that even the professor is surprised. Thus a 4.0 in her class will be very difficult, but hey I'm a creative sort.</p>

<p>The class itself is pretty large, 28 students, and at least a third of them are also working in public libraries and studying to become librarians. We already had some good conversations/debate yesterday. It should be fun.</p>

		<h2>01.19.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Have I forgotten how to read?</h3>
	
	<p>I'm slogging through "Wynar's Introduction to Cataloging and Classification" for my Friday morning class and it's slow going. </p>

<p>It's not that it's really hard to understand. Indeed, it all makes sense. For some reason I'm just having a hard time getting through it. </p>

<p>Part of it is learning to focus and strain out the outside world. For example, reading about library technology makes me think about work and everything I have to do there. </p>

<p>I think the rest of it is simply trying to read a completely different writing style. I'm used to a journalistic writing style. I read a lot of newspapers and magazines to keep up with current events. I read scientific articles regularly, but even so they are written in a very clear fashion. Everything I'm read feels as if it needs a good editing for clarity. I'm sure I'll get used to it, until then it is certainly making me feel dumb.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I'm keeping my eye on the weather. I fear I'll get to Indy and then a blizzard will move in while I'm in class. Hmmm... I wonder if they'll let me sleep on the tables in the library group study rooms.</p>

		<h2>01.17.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Good (slow) start to grad school</h3>
	
	<p>I am now officially a graduate student. I have my student ID. I attended my first class. I have my books. I took advantage of my student discount to buy some computer software (Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac $10, etc.). For the past couple of hours I've been sifting through the syllubus. Tomorrow I have a day off and will do a chunk of reading.</p>

<p><b>First impressions</b>: IUPUI is kind of a barren campus in the middle of winter. Great spanses of lawn with nothing to block the bitter wind. Other things are kind of disappointing. There's no university union for the students really and the bookstore is pretty sad. The univeristy is building a campus center for completion in 2007, but with all luck I'll be gone by then.</p>

<p>The university library, which will basically be my Friday home for the next two years, is a different story. The people are friendly and the structure has plenty of windows to let the sun shine in. [<a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/images/univlibrary_1.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.ontheriversedge.com/images/univlibrary_1.html','popup','width=138,height=281,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">View image</a>]</p>

<p>They have comfortable sitting areas behind the huge signature windows. However, the orientation doesn't lend itself to the nicest of views. The sciences building the library faces is probably only 20-years-old, but for some reason the structure is looking tired. </p>

<p>On the other hand, sitting in the study carrels, the whole southeast wall is glass and the huge windows overlook downtown Indianapolis. You can see the RCADome, the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art, the Indiana State Museum, the State House, Military Park and the skyscrapers around Monument Circle.  Nice view. I could probably site there and soak in the sun... oh yes, and study.</p>

<p>The folks in my cataloging class seem pretty cool. We have a slew of<br />
people from all walks of life-- everyone from teachers who realized they didn't want to teach to a post-doctoral information science professor wanting to expand her horizons in order to get today's "in" jobs. Only one other person working in a public library. </p>

<p>Cataloging is one of those keystone jobs. I never realized how important they were, but I'm quickly learning, the whole shooting match would be in<br />
disarray without them. I'll have to send Joy and Julie (our current and past catalogers) an extra piece of chocolate for Valentines Day.</p>

<p>My afternoon class, collection development, was cancelled as the prof was at a conference. Actually that helped because it allowed me to buy books and run errands. For example, my VPN account wasn't turned on and my webmail isn't working. I can send and receive, but I can't get replies. When I send a message, it doesn't include a "from" address. They have not yet figured that one out.</p>

<p>Darlene came up with me for the first day. She kept me company and helped celebrate my first day. After taking care of the odds and ends we wandered campus and Indy walking and driving around. </p>

<p><b>iPod craze</b>: We stopped at a Border's Books where Darlene bought a new Star Trek and a <a href="http://muttscomics.com/index.asp">Mutts</a> book. We then went to the Apple Store where everyone was drooling over the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/">iPod Shuffle</a>. They haven't been able to keep them in stock. They got a few hundred of the chewing gum stick shaped players that morning and sold them out in three hours. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, I bought the iPod I've been saving up for. I obviously wanted to listen to music (Wednesday nights in the children's room can get very quiet). But it is a handier tool than I imagined. For starters, the University Library has tons of computers so if I don't feel like lugging my laptop along, I can carry all my files along on my iPod and jack it into the firewire port. Secondly, it has all my contacts, calendars and notes. </p>

<p>Here's what I didn't expect-- I am able to put hyperlinked archives on the puppy. I downloaded a freeware program called <a href="http://www.flyingmeat.com/voodoopadlite.html">VoodooPad Lite</a>. You type a note and highlight any word. Turn that word into a link and you go to a new page where you write anything about that word. It's not unlike a Wiki website. All fine and dandy, but then it all uploaded onto the iPod-- still hyperlinked. I go to the index page and I can click around it like a webpage. That was a revelation.</p>

<p>By the end of the day we were exhausted. We rented a room and fell asleep. We woke up 12 hours later.</p>

<p><b>Georgia O'Keeffe exhibit</b>: After wandering around some more, we finally ended up at the <a href="http://www.eiteljorg.org/ejm/exhibitions.asp?ID=27">Eiteljorg Museum</a> which had just opened a new <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5707736/site/newsweek/">Georgia O'Keeffe exhibit</a>. It was simply beautiful. It'll be open for a couple of months. I plan to return. Another interesting part of the exhibit was quotes from O'Keeffe. I was also amazed how well spoken-well written she was. Unfortunately, no one there at the time knew where the quotes came from. I need to write the curator and find the source. If it was journals, I suspect they would be very good reading.</p>

<p>There were several wonderful pieces, but I'd say my favorites so far were two works she did while on assignment in Hawaii. The Dole company had commissioned her to do some work of pineapples so they could use the work for advertising. She never managed to paint a pineapple, but the two works she did paint are great. Dole later sent a pineapple plant to her home, but the painting was a disappointment.</p>

<p>That's week one down.</p>
