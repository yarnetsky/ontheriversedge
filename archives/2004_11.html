	<h3>Addiction of the day</h3>
	
	<p>We must share this joy. We, at least for the evening, became addicted to <a title="Welcome to PopCap Games - Fun, Free, Addictive Games" href="http://www.popcap.com/">PopCap Games</a>.</p>

<p>I read about it at LISNews.com. There's a fun Boggle-sorta game called Bookworm that's great (save the library by making words). I like Rocket Mania as well (connect the fuse to the rockets).</p>

<p>It's an easy way to blow an few minutes. Have fun...<br />

	<h3>Science Friday: Chocolate, Chocolate, Chocolate</h3>
	
	<p>Today is the first day of Darlene's holiday open house. It was quiet most of the day, but we've had a few people in and sold a couple things. Maybe not enough pieces to say it was worth being open for nine hours, but hey, I think a few people will be back.</p>

<p>On the table in the middle of our display is a bowl of chocolates-- mini-Snickers, dark chocolate Hershey Kisses and mini-York Peppermint Patties. It's a pretty darn good combo really.</p>

<p>It reminded me of a trio of health articles I've read on the BBC website this week about the elixir of life.</p>

<p>First up, according to a recent study, chocolate has an ingredient, theobromine, that is a third more effective at stopping persistant <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4032585.stm">coughs</a> than codeine with fewer side effects and no drowsiness.</p>

<p>Second at bat, a study from earlier this year finds that moms who <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3604275.stm">eat chocolate while pregnant</a> will have happier, livelier babies. </p>

<p>Finally, researchers are reporting this summer that dark chocolate has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3185363.stm">better anti-oxidant properties</a> than milk chocolate and thus is healthier. "Previous studies have suggested that chocolate may help to protect against heart disease and even cancer," the article stated.</p>

<p>Mind you, you still would have to deal with the high saturated fats and sugars. Oh well. I still don't think that'll stop me from having another one of those Kisses.</p>

	<h3>You say po-tah'-toe</h3>
	
	<p>I say po-tay'-toe. How about the shoes you wear in gym class? I say sneakers, but apparently everyone around here says tennis shoes.</p>

<p>What am I talking about? Check out this Harvard University <a title="Dialect Survey Login" href="http://hcs.harvard.edu/~golder/dialect/index.html">Dialect Survey</a>.</p>

<p>Either way, we've been cleaning Darlene's studio all day getting ready for the open house. We doubled our sales floor space (now we have to fill it). We've finally crashed and eaten our Thanksgiving dinner of spinach-garlic-mushroom pizza and pumpkin pie (interesting combo).</p>

<p>Happy Thanksgiving.</p>

	<h3>More vacation snippets</h3>
	
	<p>We got back from vacation late on Saturday night. Boy it went too quick. We had a lot of fun though. Now we're busting our butts getting ready for Darlene's <a href="http://www.mudcatpottery.com">holiday open house</a>.</p>

<p><b>Niagara Falls</b></p>

<p>While we spent most of the week with my mom, we visited Niagara Falls for an evening and a morning. </p>

<p>Our first stop was on Goat Island, the island that is between the American and Horseshoe Falls (sometimes called the "Canadian Falls" even though half of it is in the United States).</p>

<p>We saw these weird white boxes everywhere and had to ask a ranger. They cover the stalks of lamp posts to protect them during the winter. Why? Well, the ranger said ice from the mist builds up all winter to a height of two dozen feet. "See those snow fenses? Those will soon be covered in ice and we'll put two more layers on top of that before the winter is done." No wonder the trees on the edge of the island are knarly.</p>

<p>The ranger told us he was amazed at how people left their common sense at home when they visited. People regularly climb safety fenses for a better view or wade into the rapids. The rapids don't look bad in places, but one slip and you are over the falls in 20 seconds. He even stopped a mom who was wading with her baby in the water off the Three Sister Islands. It's even worse when he has to communicate danger to someone who doesn't understand English.</p>

<p>We stayed at a hotel near the international bridge. We got a good deal on a room complete with a jacuzzi, a king bed, a fake fireplace, odd wallpaper and way too many mirrors for our tastes. But hey it was fun. </p>

<p>We walked all over the place that night. The falls are illuminated at night with huge colored beams from the Canadian side. The light show was nice, but watching mist from the Horseshoe Falls swirl and dance reflecting the colored lights was downright cool. </p>

<p>Literally and figuratively. If you've never been to the falls, there is a zone where it rains 24-7. In the summer it's blessedly cool, but in the fall and winter it is downright freezing. Thus we truly enjoyed the jacuzzi when we walked back to the hotel.</p>

<p><b>Buffalo-Erie County Public Library</b></p>

<p>We visited the Buffalo-Erie County Public Library and I had a rather interesting experience. </p>

<p>First strike. I walked into the downtown branch and saw a kiosk design I liked so I went to take a picture to share the idea with my director. Instantly the security guards pounced and ordered me not to take the photo. When I explained why I wanted the photo and asked why I couldn't take it, they escorted me clear across the library to the administrative offices. Apparently they had a slew of places they didn't want photos taken so they just made a blanket "no photos without permission" policy. Unfortunately, it's not posted anywhere and having a security guard sic you isn't the best way of implementing the policy. Whatever.</p>

<p>Second strike. I had to email an ad to our local paper. I called ahead to see if the library had CD drives so I wouldn't have to drag my laptop to a downtown wi-fi hotspot. The person on the phone said sure, no problem. I get down there with CD in hand and they did not have CD drives. Bad information. grrrrrrrrrrrr. Maybe the good Lord was trying to give me one of those "this is why you need to double-check your information before telling patrons" kind of lessons.</p>

<p>Third strike. Mark Twain lived in Buffalo for about 18 months. He was part owner of a daily paper there and had just married. They left after tragedy struck her family and moved to Elmira, NY. Either way, Buffalo is proud of its Twain year and the library was given the ORIGINAL manuscript of Huck Finn. I saw several pages of the manuscript. It's wonderful to see the effort of handwriting. As a result, the library gift shop has a lot of Twain memorabilia. Unfortunately, because I got dragged to the admin offices and talked with the tech guy to see if he could help me (he couldn't) I missed seeing the gift shop. It closed three minutes before we got there.</p>

<p>The central branch is undergoing a major renovation and I look forward to seeing the results. Unfortunately, the libraries are in danger of closing as Medicaid is eating the county's budget alive. The county executive has threatened to close everything (libraries, zoo, etc.) if he doesn't get a hike in sales tax to 9.25%. We'll see what happens over the next two weeks.</p>

<p><b>Frank Lloyd Wright</b></p>

<p>Another favorite stop was touring the "opus" of Frank Lloyd Wright's Prarie-style homes-- the <a href="http://www.darwinmartinhouse.org/">Darwin Martin House</a>. </p>

<p>It was built in 1903-1905 for Martin who was a top executive with the huge Larkin Soap Company. Unfortunately, during the depression he lost a boat load of money (like everyone else) and died deeply in debt. As a result his wife had to abandon the property. It was then vacant for nearly 15 years when a local architect bought it and saved it from destruction. Now, umpteen years later, they are working on giving it a proper restoration.</p>

<p>Wright's attention to detail was astounding, he literally designed to control the house's occupants. Through the design, he controlled where you walked, where you stopped, where you looked and, because he even designed almost all the furniture, how you lived. Amazing.</p>

<p>The 90-minute tour was well worth the $10 ticket. I'll visit it again in a couple years to see the progress. </p>

<p>Wright did a lot of work in Buffalo, in large part due to Darwin Martin. Wright did a crack job for Martin because he knew his company was wanting a new corporate headquarters. He indeed got the contract and the resulting <a href="http://www.pbs.org/flw/buildings/larkin/larkin.html">Larkin Building</a> was not only his first major project, but also rather innovative. Unfortunately, when Larkin closed they could not come up with another use for the structure and it was demolished in 1950.</p>

<p>Other structures were planned, but not built. The city is now working on completing several of his unfinished projects. One of them just finished is the "Blue Sky Mausoleum" which at first seems odd, but slowly strikes one as very peaceful. It grows on you. Here's an <a href="http://archrecord.construction.com/news/daily/archives/041122wright.asp">article</a> on the project from Architectural Record.</p>

		<h2>11.15.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Vacation snippets</h3>
	
	<p>Boy is it good to be on vacation in a blue state (hardly any Bush stickers to look at).</p>

<p>We visited Niagara-on-the-Lake today, a wonderful Victorian resort sorta town with a ton of wineries (didn't go to any) and lots of theatre (didn't see any) and lots of shops (we definitely did the shops). I bought a really cool <a href="http://www.hannahats.com">Irish-style hat</a>, Darlene bought a bowl and platter from Lakeshore Pottery and we started our Christmas shopping for Darlene's family.</p>

<p>There are a ton of squirells who are a little too used to human beings. Darlene was about to offer a black squirrel a piece of a scone when the squirrel ran up her leg and literally ripped the food from her fingers clawing into her thumb in the process. We were STUNNED to say the least. Darlene reports that it was one hell of a strong squirrel that did not want to let go of her finger.</p>

<p>We've also taken in some good art at the Burchfield-Penny Art Center, some good shopping at one of the greatest grocery chains we've ever been to (Wegmans, which is out of Rochester, NY) and rewatched one of the best animated films ever made, The Iron Giant.</p>

<p>Photos, including the black attack squirrel will be posted when we get home.</p>

	<h3>Help our soldiers</h3>
	
	<p>It's Veterans Day and a day to make a difference!</p>

<p>Apparently our wounded soldiers at Walter Reed Medical Hospital do not have paid long distance phone calls.  Thus the most needed item right now is phone cards so that our soldiers can call family and friends.  </p>

<p>Here's the link with the: <a title="Democratic Underground Forums - Wounded Troops At Reed Need Phone Cards" href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address=106x12563">details</a>.</p>

	<h3>Enron time for the White House</h3>
	
	<p>Bush is appointing <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=536&e=1&u=/ap/20041110/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/bush_cabinet">Alberto Gonzales</a> as attorney general?!? </p>

<p>On one hand, it would be great to have more Latinos in positions of power, but doesn't it make you wonder when Bush appoints the former counsel of Enron to be the counsel of the White House?</p>

<p>This also happens to be the guy who wrote a legal opinion for the Bushies that basically argued we didn't have to observe the Geneva Convention. geesh...</p>

		<h2>11.09.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Just read the First Amendment</h3>
	
	<p>I just had an interesting experience, I actually read the First Amendment of the <a title="LII: Constitution" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html">Bill of Rights</a> for the first time in a long time.</p>

<p>There is a word in the first phrase that is often included that is not really there.</p>

<blockquote>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. </blockquote>

<p>It's interesting how a single word, indeed a single letter, can influence how people think about the amendment.</p>

		<h2>11.06.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Sunny side up.</h3>
	
	<p>My mom wrote that she was too cynical to believe that Kerry could win. I wish I were that cynical. It would be a lot easier to take the loss.</p>

<p>Darlene and I are starting to recover from the shock. We're alternating as to which of us is depressed and which of us is angry as hell.</p>

<p>I kept thinking all the bad news would catch up with Bush. I kept thinking people would realize Kerry's immense value to our country. I underestimated how little people pay attention to the elections. I'm amazed how much people will put up with to have a candidate they agreed with. </p>

<p>I'm astounded at how truly awful the media was over the past year. There were so many issues and statements that needed analyzing and all they could do was talk about Cheney's daughter. Now Bush is talking about restructuring Social Security and our tax laws. The press barely mentioned these so-called priorities during the election. </p>

<p>Similarly, I wonder if they'll report on the true disaster Ohio and Florida has become. I'm not one to believe in conspiracies, but it is hard to swallow results when voters receive ballots pre-punched with Bush (if they punch Kerry the ballot is tossed as spoiled). It's hard to swallow when a machine gives Bush 4,000 more votes than are registered at the precinct. It's hard to swallow when 58,000 absentee ballots disappear. Way too many instances to believe fraud did not take place.</p>

<p>My father-in-law who lives in western Ohio said he saw no reason to vote when the election would get stolen anyway. I convinced him to vote anyway, but somehow I suspect it may be hard to get him to vote again.</p>

<p>As I look to the future I wonder how one combats against a party that submerges you in a swamp of lies and then screams we're playing dirty politics when we tell the public we're being drown. I wonder how one combats against a party that has mastered the art of fog and deceit. Mastered voter fraud and voter disenfranchisement in a way not seen since Jim Crow.</p>

<p>But most of all, please don't get me going about morality and politics. </p>

<p>On occasion, however, I've been able to pull back and look at how far we've managed to come. In theory we should have been defeated by the biggest landslide in history. Instead, 49 percent of the country said they did not want Bush as president.</p>

<p>Basically we're media starved and we need to work on how we explain our core values to the public. Beyond that I believe a good chunk of the infrastructure is in place for future victories. We have excellent fund raising and a GOTV machines. Even in Congress, we should have lost more than we did. We lost only four seats when the Republicans figured they'd gain seven seats in Texas alone. We also performed well at the state level gaining six legislatures. For example, Democrats rule the Colorado legislature for the first time in 50 years. We just have to keep pushing. </p>

<p>Second terms are messy and the Bush administration has shown no talent so far at getting themselves out of the muck, so here's to looking at 2006.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I'm going to see if I can get registered for spring classes. I'm looking at L520 Bibliographic Access and Control and L528 Collection Development.</p>

	<h3>Darlene's take</h3>
	
	<p>Still trying to accept the election results. I can not believe our country has made such a colossal mistake.  We will all pay for it.  Mark my words.</p>

<p>On the good side, the Republicans are going to have to clean up their own messes both here and abroad.  Kerry will not be blamed for not being able to fix everything Bush screwed up within 4 years.  The bad news is that he has 4 years to make it worse.</p>

<p>While I still question the validity of the election (no paper backup on many machines in Ohio and Florida so why even consider a recount, a machine in Ohio that tallied an extra 4000 or so votes - all for Bush, and both state's exit polls showing an entirely different story than the ballots). Kerry was correct in that there were not enough provisional ballots to change the result.  It seems that the gay rights issues, abortion, and just plain fear brought out many of the Republican voters. How the soaring deficit, struggling economy, jobs going overseas, environmental issues, not to mention the nightmare in Iraq can be ignored is beyond me.</p>

<p>So what do we do now?  We need to pay attention these next four years and hold this administration accountable.  Be as informed as possible. Read the news, instead of just getting 30 second sound bites on the television.  We have a great resource of national and international newspapers on the internet.</p>

<p>I am sorry for the kids as well. It was a very close race and they can be proud that our candidate did so well against so much misinformation.  Our country made a mistake.  It happens, and we must do everything we can to make sure it does not happen again.</p>

<p>I believe Kerry would have been a president who united our nation.  I am sorry we will not have the benefit of his wisdom, experience and patriotism.</p>

<p>I am praying for all of our futures,<br />
Darlene</p>

		<h2>11.03.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>I guess noone wanted to change horsemen mid-apocolypse</h3>
	
	<p>Well... I've once again been proven to be in the minority. Just about every candidate I voted for, with the exception of some county offices, lost.</p>

<p>Not only did Kerry lose, but we lost our Democratic state representative, we lost our Democrat U.S. Representative, we lost our Democrat governor.</p>

<p>I have tons of thoughts going through my mind. All I can hope is we can prove to be an effective "loyal opposition."</p>

<p>For better or worse, 33 percent of the country is living in a fantasy world. Unfortunately that's enough to elect a president. They believe what they are being told even when proof exists to the contrary. They are voting their fears and they are voting on social issues when we have the world at stake. </p>

<p>gotta get to work and live life again...</p>

		<h2>11.02.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>*sigh*</h3>
	
	<p>It's finally coming to an end. I'm feeling optimistic, but I hope Kerry can win by enough of a margin that our country can avoid lawsuit city. I read an allusion that Ohio is already full of lawsuits, though I haven't read anything specific.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I'm not sure which is worse, seeing results come in or not seeing results come in.</p>

<p>The exit polls looked very good for Kerry and that is good, but we lost a Democratic governor in Indiana and I may be losing my Democratic congressman.</p>

<p>I'd love to do something to different than to follow the results. But I don't think I could concentrate on something like watching a movie. </p>

<p>The results are looking discouraging, but yet it's too early to be discouraged. When only 25% of a state is reporting, it's too early to panic.</p>

<p>more later</p>

	<h3>Happy Pruning Day</h3>
	
	<p>To all 100 or so daily readers I ask that you go out and vote. </p>

<p>To my Republican friends, I still believe it's a mistaken vote, but I'll love you anyway. </p>

<p>To my Democratic friends... GET OUT THERE! It's time to replant the Bush. (hisss...booooo....bad pun!)</p>

<p>Either way...</p>

<h4>what.</h4>
<ul><li>This is a journal of our life, culture, libraries, the Apple Macintosh, progressive politics, and of course historic Madison, Indiana, the most beautiful rivertown in America.</li></ul>

<h4>who.</h4> 

<ul><li>G'day, I'm E.G. Yarnetsky and I answer questions at our local library. I'm preparing to go to grad school in January. I'm a former journalist who still dabbles in design work. My wife's a potter who makes beautiful functional and sculptural ceramics.</li></ul>
