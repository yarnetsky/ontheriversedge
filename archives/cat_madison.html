<p class="description">Fact and Fiction from America's most beautiful rivertown.</p>


<h4>Archives: Madison</h4>

	<h3>Madison in spring album</h3>
	
	<p>It's a couple months late, but I finally have time to post some more photos. Once again these are some photos Darlene took. She's pretty much commendeered the camera.</p>

<p>Either way, we're dedicating this album to Nathan and Anne, a truly wonderful couple from Dallas, Texas, we met yesterday. They are considering a move to the most beautiful rivertown in America and were quizzing us. Yet we found many commonalities that led to four hours of fun conversation. We hope to someday have them as neighbors.</p>

<p>--Hope y'all had a safe drive home and here are some photos to hold you over.</p>

		<h2>04.23.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Weird April weather</h3>
	
	<p>Driving home from Indianapolis after classes last night was a real experience. </p>

<p>The sky turned green and I can't even begin to describe what the clouds looked like. Sufice it to say that they weren't the usual flat bottomed cumulonimbus.</p>

<p>A minute later all hell broke loose with wind and rain so hard I couldn't see out my windshield. I pulled over and watched the hail bounce all over the place.</p>

<p>I called Darlene on my cell and she told me there were tornado warnings to my east and north. No surprise there.</p>

<p>It finally slowed and I drove home. I passed a ton of cars hiding under overpasses which I could have sworn I heard was the worst thing to do.</p>

<p>About a 40 minutes later the western sky cleared and the setting sun illuminated the treetops. It was unreal. The tree bottoms were still shadowed by the storm clouds, but a sharp line of bright (and I mean bright) green leaves contrasted against a still inky sky. I drove bugeyed through the light rain watching the scene when suddenly a bright double rainbow highlighted the road infront of me. Of course, the rainbow (and the road) ended in Madison.</p>

<p>This morning my father-in-law called. The same storm system is now hitting them and they're expecting 4 inches of snow. Unfortunately, all their fruit trees are in blossom and they're going to lose all the pre-started corn they planted just last week.</p>

<p>March came in like a lion and out like a lamb. April came in like a lamb and is leaving like an angry ram.</p>

		<h2>04.16.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>"Madison" premieres tomorrow</h3>
	
	<p>Jim Caviezel and Jake Lloyd will be in Madison tomorrow for the premiere of "Madison." There will be a red carpet event at our favorite movie palace-- the 1938 art deco Ohio Theatre. </p>

<p>Apparently there is a dress code for the premiere and Darlene told me she heard a few people won't be going after buying tickets because they weren't allowed to wear jeans.</p>

<p>They closed Main Street at noon today and are erecting a block worth of party tents for the after-movie fiesta that comes with the $40 movie tickets. There will apparently be a block party for the "rest of us" on the next block with music playing all evening.</p>

<p>If the party were elsewhere in town I'd skip it and just wait for the movie to open normally on the 22nd. However, it's only a block away so I guess I should wander up the block and check it out.</p>

<p>Mind you, it would be cool to be on the second or third floors of one of the downtown buildings and watch it all from a birds eye view. ahhh, the old reporter's instincts are still there.</p>

	<h3>Madison...the movie</h3>
	
	<p>Well, after many years of waiting, "Madison" the movie will finally premiere in our wonderful rivertown this weekend and on April 22 will be released in cities around the country that understand hydroplane racing. If it suceeds there, it will spread to other markets.</p>

<p>I just posted a "skyscrapper" ad on my site so you can enter a contest for a free boat and watch the latest trailer. It's a pretty good trailer and you get glimpses of our rivertown. </p>

<p>The movie was shot here in town a few years back. I did some coverage of it for the newspaper and for a very long afternoon I was an extra on the set. I doubt I'll make it as I heard they decided to reshoot the scenes I was in (a pancake fundraiser scene).</p>

<p>I did meet many of the actors include Jake Lloyd (Star Wars I) and his family. There is a scene in the movie where he is biking down the boat ramp. I took some photos for the paper and talked to him just before he shot the scene. Ironically, his sister's name is Madison (which apparently is now the second most popular girl's name in the country).</p>

<p>The town certainly left an impression on the cast and crew. Indeed, on completing the movie, one of the top crewmembers decided to leave Los Angeles and move here. She now runs a shop on Main Street called <a href="http://www.theprincessandthebead.com">Princess and the Bead</a>.</p>

		<h2>03.30.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Only in Madison</h3>
	
	<p>It's been a beautiful day today. A good day for bike riding .... and bike buying. </p>

<p>Since last summer we've been saying we'd go over to <a href="www.fizzzbikeshop.com">Fizz'z Bike Shop</a> here downtown and get a bike ordered for Darlene. For fun, she added, "I hope I can get a green one."</p>

<p>Well, I stopped at Fizz'z this evening because my tires were running a few psi low. Low and behold, there was a custom bike the guys there had put together. It was her size and, of course, it was green. </p>

<p>So I dragged her over there and she took it for a spin. She loved it. She picked out a helmet (yes, we wear helmets and so should you!) and a lock for the bike. Finally, I pulled out the checkbook and -- wrong checkbook.</p>

<p>"Just take it all home and come back tomorrow and pay for it," Joey said.</p>

<p>After a short ride around town on her new bike, Darlene wheeled her bike into the pottery. "Only in Madison could I take a bike home without paying for it," she said beaming.</p>

<p>Mind you, Joey did say something to the effect of "It's OK, we know where to find you and Jerry." Ah, that oh so trusting, mafia-style acknowledgement that you live in a small town. </p>

<p>And yes, he does know where to find me. The night before, Joey had given a "bicycle into spring" workshop for the library that turned out really, really good. I had organized the program and lucked into getting really good press coverage to boot-- front page story and three photos. For once I ended up on the front page for something other than Historic Board.</p>

<p>Here's the article: <a title="Expert offers advice for safe, fun bicycling" href="http://www.madisoncourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=4&SubSectionID=253&ArticleID=23091&TM=67352.75">Expert offers advice for safe, fun bicycling</a> and <a href="http://www.madisoncourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=26&SubSectionID=813&PhotoID=11216&UID=21">another photo</a>. Yes, that's me in the background and that's my bike he's using in the program.</p>

<p>And yes, Darlene will be at Fizz'z front door at 10 a.m. tomorrow morning. Actually, she's writing out the check as I finish this.</p>

	<h3>The Ohio is out and about</h3>
	
	<p><img alt="Ohioflooded.jpg" src="http://www.ontheriversedge.com/images/Ohioflooded.jpg" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></p>

<p>The river is now definitely out of its banks, fortunately we're only looking at minor flooding here. While it's covered our riverfront road and parklands, I'm hoping it stays out of the few houses that are down on the river front. They suffered enough in 1997.</p>

<p>I posted a <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/egyarnetsky/PhotoAlbum5.html">new album of photos</a> Darlene and I took yesterday and today. When you check out the photos, take a look at the riverfront light posts. When the flood waters of 1997 crested, only the globe on top was above the water.</p>

<p>For those who know Madison, the photo above is taken at dusk looking west from the <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?country=US&addtohistory=&formtype=address&searchtype=address&cat=&address=Elm%20St%20%26%20W%20Vaughn%20Dr&city=Madison&state=IN&zipcode=47250&searchtab=home">foot of Elm Street</a> (three blocks south of our library). The walled area is the lower lawn of the Lanier Mansion.</p>

<p>The river's expected to crest tomorrow late morning. We'll be out taking more photos. It's odd to be gawkers. I guess it's the old journalistic instincts to go out and cover the story.</p>

<p>For "real" daily coverage, however, check the <a href="www.madisoncourier.com">The Madison Courier</a>.</p>

		<h2>01.08.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Waters are a coming?</h3>
	
	<p>Well, I guess the Midwest can't get a snow storm and then days of rain without the Ohio River sending it all back our way.</p>

<p>The National Weather Service's <a href="http://www.crh.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ahps.cgi?LMK&clfi3">Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service</a> is saying the Ohio River will likely top flood stage here in Madison Sunday morning. Here's the graph...</p>

<p><img alt="clfi3.gif" src="http://www.ontheriversedge.com/images/clfi3.gif" width="450" height="350" border="0" /></p>

<p>I covered the last flood in 1997 extensively for <a href="http://www.madisoncourier.com">The Madison Courier</a>. I'm hoping there won't be a repeat. Houses along Vaughn Drive (our river road) were flooded halfway up the first floor. The river hit 460.90 feet, the eighth worst recorded flood at Madison.</p>

<p>It was amazingly scary to look inside the homes after being visited by the Ohio River. A half foot of river silt covered every surface from the floor to the sinks. The walls were laid bare half-way to the ceiling, the drywall disintegrated. We are so used to seeing the barriers, suddenly seeing straight through a house with only beams in the way is like looking at a ghost.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: The river crests are measured from sea level, not the bottom of the river. For comparison, the river bottom at Madison is at 403.2 or 402.3 (I can never remember which). It's normal depth at this time of year would probably be about 420. I added the river stage under Madison links. </p>

		<h2>12.29.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>The big melt</h3>
	
	<p>Madison, Indiana, the most beautiful slush city in America.</p>

<p>The "official" tally was 18-inches of snow in 24-hours. The total landed our county on the state's emergency disaster aid list in the state. That might help pay the overtime of our diehard snow guys. They did an awesome job even working through Christmas, though they did take turns going home for periods to be with family.</p>

<p>That subsequent freeze caused havoc on our town's guttering. Buildings all across downtown had huge icicles hanging from the roof as the downspouts froze over.</p>

<p>Across the street this morning, absolutely huge gutter-shaped chunks of ice came raining down on the sidewalk as the guttering collapsed.</p>

<p>Another building had their windows cracked by cascading ice. </p>

<p>At our library, a frozen downspout caused the melting snow and ice water to run down the side of the building and flooding into the children's room. We got the books off the shelf largely in time, though we lost maybe 8 books. When I pulled one of the wet books off the shelf, it was entitled-- "I Got Wet."</p>

<p>Go figure.</p>

		<h2>12.26.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Our snow from Darlene's perspective</h3>
	
	<p><b>Editor's note</b>: <i>This is an edited version of what Darlene wrote my mom. It stated our situation so perfectly that I got her permission to post it here. Here's Darlene...</i></p>

<p>Imagine our downtown where many of the residents do not have off street parking.  Now imagine 17 inches of snow dumped on that town in less than 48 hours...</p>

<p>Jer and I returned this afternoon and I parked the van in the space we dug it out of.  As soon as I pulled all the way in, it occurred to me that getting back out could be a challenge.  Said parking space is still snow covered, a bit slippery, and the nose of the van is downhill a bit from the rear of the van.</p>

<p>Out of sheer stubborness I decided I was going to try to get van out myself and pick Jerry up at 5.  Felt I should have practice in doing this sort of thing as you never know when you might need the skills.  Proceeded outside.</p>

<p>Cardboard under wheels- no luck.  Moving van back and forth, no luck.  (only proceeded in moving to the far right side of the parking space) Hopped out of car to reposition cardboard.  Landed in 3 foot drift, slid out of drift to bounce on my kneecaps on the street. (3 points for humoring any onlookers at gas station). Repositioned cardboard, trudged back through snowdrift and tried again.  It is about 22 degrees outside and 2 kind boys on bikes volunteered to push. They were not very large, but quite insistent.  (a bit bored I suspect) No luck.  Man pulls up in truck, attaches chain to van and with boys pushing on other end I am freed!</p>

<p>Slowly make my way across slush covered streets to library where I happily drop the problem in Jerry's lap.  Ok hon, if we park in our space, we may not be able to get back out again.  Other spaces either have 4 foot drifts in them or cars covered in four foot drifts in them.  City lots are still snow covered.</p>

<p>Head to nearest city parking lot.  Maybe it was more usable than it appeared.  Just before pulling in ran into friend Ellen who had just her own car freed from the snow.  Jerry proceeds cautiously into lot not realizing where Ellen had just been freed from!  Immediately get stuck in same mess that Ellen had just been pulled from in said parking lot.  Ellen's husband and father in law and another friendly bystander along with Jerry proceed to push us out of drift and some kind (and probably exasperated) soul with a front loader plows a path to allow us to get out of the lot.</p>

<p>So with no other parking opportunities, we were forced back to our same sloping parking space that we dug ourselves out of Thursday and will probably have to be pushed out of Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>This is how we are managing the snow here in Madison. ( I am really glad we are not in Texas or Louisiana!)  I can't wait to see what happens when businesses and the courthouse, city hall etc. reopen tomorrow.</p>

<p>I asked for snow and so far I am still amused by it.</p>

		<h2>12.24.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Snippets from the snow zone</h3>
	
	<p><b>Planting the flag</b>: The pile of snow now in front of our shop is maybe five feet tall. We figured no one would see our sandwich sign that we were open today so Darlene climbed the snow mountain and planted our open flag on top. I'll post a photo later.</p>

<p><b>NekoBus unburied</b>: It took us more than an hour, but we managed to shovel our van out last night. We really have no desire to go anywhere, but I knew we wouldn't want to tackle it with temps in the single digits if we had an emergency. It was parked close to the corner, but the city dozer (pictured in previous post) was nicer to us and didn't dump any snow on us.</p>

<p><b>Not so lucky on Main</b>: One of our friends is a shopkeep that lives above her store on Main Street. Yesterday, she unburied her car so she could get to work today. Overnight the snow plow buried her in again-- five feet deep. </p>

<p>According to Darlene, she was mad as a hornet this morning. "I'm sending a bill to the governor. There were only two cars on the block, they could have put the snow behind me." </p>

<p>Knowing her luck the state, which plows Main Street, would probably say something like "a snow emergency means no cars on the street, parking included." It doubt it wouldn't mean anything to them that her nearest off street parking was two blocks away in a snow bound parking lot she couldn't get into.</p>

<p><b>No snowmen</b>: The snow is very heavy and a couple of my muscles were rather sore after shoveling. As heavy as it was, the stuff still too powdery. Darlene and I wanted to make a snowman infront of our shop, but it wouldn't ball up. Mind you the creation would have been buried by the plow. Would that have been considered murder?</p>

<p><b>Roundabout</b>: We heard from a customer that I-75 in Ohio is really slow going. The Ohio Dept. of Transportation website said much of it is snow covered and icy. Mind you, there are several variations of snow covered and icy. Is it, snowy but drivable or is it you're crazy to try it snowy and ice covered?</p>

<p> Louisville didn't get as much snow as we did, but they got a lot more ice and the roads are a mess.</p>

	<h3>Beep, beep, beep</h3>
	
	<p>I heard the backup alarms and scraping sounds loudly from our living room. I poked my head around the curtain and snapped some photos. We now have a mountain outside our front door.</p>

	<h3>White white white</h3>
	
	<p>According to the local paper we got 17 inches of snow. The temperature has not plunged yet so we walked around town and took about 80 photos with our digital camera. </p>

<p>Here are 21 of our favorite <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/egyarnetsky/PhotoAlbum2.html">photos</a> of the morning. [<b>UPDATE</b>: <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/egyarnetsky/PhotoAlbum3.html">More photos</a>] Click on any of the photos to start the slide show. Click on any of the slide photo shots for a bigger image.</p>

<p>Mind you, after a while you can only take so many photos of white stuff covering stuff.</p>

<p>it is supposed to get very windy and very cold over the next couple of days. Tonight they're calling for 3 above, a high of 11 tomorrow and -7 on Christmas eve. Wind chill of -25. ugh.  If it get's that cold, it looking like we may well skip going to family in Ohio for Christmas.</p>

<p>We got a call from Darlene's sister who said her husband, a truck drive, has been stuck all night at a truck stop just north of Findlay, Ohio. Poor guy. They have blizzard advisory right now.</p>

		<h2>09.21.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Just under flood stage</h3>
	
	<p>I really need to get down to see the river. I think I'll get up early to do so tomorrow. The Ohio takes on a very different look when it is high. If it wasn't for the rushing water, it would seem more like a lake. </p>

<p>It's around the 444 foot level with flood stage at 451. It's peaking now and is supposed to be down to 440 by Friday, still a bank full, but definitely no flooding.</p>

<p>Darlene said it's a mess down there. Tons of debris floating down river. She said she thought she saw a 'fridge float down. Our daily newspaper's photographer told her he thought he saw an outhouse. Lots of barrels and trees.</p>

<p>Lots of people have been down by the river watching it go by. Guys sitting at the side of the street fishing -- normally you'd have to walk *down* a good 20 feet to get to the river. Nearby, E.G. (the Egyptian goose on the riverfront, not me) was huddling with his new found cohort Aneg (ANother Egyptian Goose). All the geese were displaced to parkland across the street.</p>

<p>It seems sad that we're watching the river flow by with an odd fascination as towns in Pennsylvania, W.Virginia and North Carolina are getting swept away by the remnents of Ivan. We didn't get the rain so there is a disconnect when we watch the swollen river.</p>

		<h2>05.27.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Even cicadas like our library</h3>
	
	<p>I've heard people call Brood X an invasion. The cicadas are definitely in full force here in Madison and we are inundated with the red-eyed, vainy-winged bugs.</p>

<p>As the front door of our library opens, the buzz roars in and fades out as the door shuts once again.</p>

<p>That's been the scenario for the past 10 days. Today, however, I think the cicadas have finally realized what a cool library we have. They're riding their way in on the backs of our patrons.</p>

<p>This afternoon, a mom was checking out books as I was helping her daughter learn how to use Indiana's Virtual Library <a href="http://www.inspire.net">Inspire.net</a>. Suddenly, we heard a very loud chirping from across the reading room. The young woman's mother was jumping around clearly stunned. Soon, the poor woman realized there was a cicada in her purse. </p>

<p>Not three minutes later, I'm still helping the student find journal articles on viruses and an older gentleman walked in and started chirping as well. As he found one in his pocket, the two of us couldn't keep from laughing. He promptly dropped it on the floor and crunched it with his foot. Just what we needed, crushed cicada on our carpet.</p>

<p>An hour later, I was checking out some videos for a young man who suddenly grabbed at his neck and found a cicada crawling down the collar of his shirt. Even knowing he had it in his hand we both jumped when the thing started chirping. Those puppies are loud.</p>

<p>The buggers are falling from the trees, swarm at the lightest distraction and, unlike flies, know nothing of people, dogs, cars or anything else on earth for that matter. They're all over the sidewalks and streets, many dead having been stomped on or driven over. I had a couple "riding" on my bike. </p>

<p>They're even showing public displays of affection.  I now regularly see pairs of cicadas on top of each. I was suddenly glad not to have children at this immediate point. Not only would I have to explain the birds and the bees, but cicadas as well. </p>

<p>One of our patrons in this very boat said she was very happy when her kid readily settled for the answer of "they're mating." She's not sure if the child knew what the word meant, but was happy to not have to explain it.</p>

<p>While I'm glad we've visited by Brood X only once every 17 years, I'm enjoying the spectacle. </p>

<p>This morning I went to the Hanover College library to pick up some inter-library loan books that were mis-routed seven miles in the wrong direction. Hanover is a very leafy campus and it was evident from the holes in the ground that there were a few million bugs along with the 2,000 students. </p>

<p>The funny thing was the sound. There were so many of them that the overall aural feel of the cicada calls had changed. Instead of sounding like crickets on acid, the hum took on a whiring sound not unlike what you'd hear from space ships in 1950s sci-fi movies.</p>

<p>Hmmm, maybe we are being invaded.</p>

	<h3>Snow in mid-April???</h3>
	
	<p><img alt="snow out our window" src="http://www.ontheriversedge.com/archives/snowoutourwindow.jpg" width="300" height="203" border="1" /></p>

<p>You have to understand that this is an area where we get dafodils and tulips in mid-March. Winter end there.</p>

<p>But on Tuesday it snowed, covering blooming dogwoods and redbuds with heavy, slushy snow.</p>

<p>While I was attending the Indiana Library Federation annual conference in Indianapolis, an odd front moved through that dumped 2-6 inches of really wet, heavy snow along the Ohio River valley upriver from Louisville. </p>

<p>My boss and I were driving down I-65 when it started raining hard as we left Indy. Sometime after we passed Columbus, Ind., Charlene asked "what is that stuff." The white stuff was only in patches, but as we drove further south it piled up. </p>

<p>By the time we got off the Interstate onto IN-256 it was obvious we had a mid-spring snow storm. Cars and trucks were spun off the road. Soon we caught up to the snow plow that sent plumes of snow (and several trash cans) 20 feet into the air.</p>

<p>The bushes were heavy with snow, green leaves and flowers pokes out from the snow. It was quite beautiful.</p>

<p>I wish I had actually witnessed the event unstead of the after effects.</p>

<p>Darlene said it started with rain and turned to a heavy sleet. Soon silver dollar-sized flakes fell in the heaviest snow seen the whole year.</p>

<p>Darlene said her favorite, though sad episode of the snow was a police car who flew down Main Street toward a wreck on the west end of town. As he crossed the railroad bridge, he hit black ice, spun out and hit a car. That car hit another car and that car hit a house.</p>

<p>The next morning I biked to work, the snow was already gone a mid-spring night's dream.</p>

	<p>The Japanese companies in our city donate a number of blossoming cherry trees that are on our riverfront. They are beautiful right now, every branch is enveloped with blooms. Darlene took this photo yesterday.</p>

	<h3>Egyptian goose followup</h3>
	
	<p>When we saw an Egyptian goose  on our riverfront (photo at left) we were curious how a native African bird could end up on the Ohio River. <a href="http://www.ontheriversedge.com/archives/000274.html">(read earlier post)</a></p>

<p>Thus I sent an email to the Louisville Zoo asking if they had an idea how he could have gotten here.</p>

<p>Here is the response:</p>

<blockquote>Mr. Yarnetsky, I have just received an answer from our lead Bird-keeper, Mr. Johnson. 

<p>Yes, the photo is indeed an Egyptian goose. Mr. Johnson does not think that it is from the Zoo.  Egyptian Geese are pretty common in Kentucky through mail order companies.  They are usually also found for sale at the Kentucky State Fair each week.</p>

<p>Good eye in spotting the bird!<br />
Gary Michael</blockquote></p>

<p>An unusual find, but apparently not THAT unusual. We'll take a sacred Egyptian bird on our riverfront nonetheless.</p>

	<h3>Duck, Duck, Egyptian Goose?</h3>
	
	<p>We definitely have been enjoying the milder weather. I'm biking to work again and Darlene's out walking the riverfront daily. After a said walk, she reported to me there was a pretty neat bird skulking along with our local flock of mallards, Canada geese and other domestic fowl that like hanging out where people toss free food.</p>

<p>As it hit 60 today, we took the camera for some birding. Lo and behold, there was a pretty neat bird sitting on the banks of the Ohio.</p>

<p><img alt="Egyptian goose" src="http://www.ontheriversedge.com/archives/egyptian.jpg" border="0" /></p>

<p>What's weird however, is this bird, an <a href="http://www.zoo.org/educate/fact_sheets/savana/egoose.htm">Egyptian Goose</a>, does not belong here. It's not even in a migratory pattern through here. It's supposed to be living in the Nile valley, the sub-Sahara or Western Europe. While common in Africa, it's a sacred bird in Egypt.</p>

<p>Where this Egyptian Goose came from is anyone's guess. There's good odds it has escaped from a zoo or private collection.</p>

<p>Maybe he's slowly working its way down the Ohio to Cairo, Ill., thinking its heading to Cairo, Egypt, on the Nile.</p>

<p>Hey, it's name starts with my initials and we found it "on the rivers edge" so for now he's my website mascot.</p>

	<h3>I'm a published restaurant critic</h3>
	
	<p>When Darlene's sister's family came to visit, we all descended on <a title="Mundt's Candies" href="http://www.mundtscandies.com">Mundt's Candies</a> here in downtown Madison. I know the owner, Maryanne Imes, but the gang had such a good time that I wrote up a review so others could enjoy this awesome place. </p>

<p>Read my first <a title="Roadfood.com" href="http://www.roadfood.com/Reviews/Writeup.aspx?ReviewID=2026&RefID=1962">Roadfood.com review</a>. I had a lot of fun writing it. I may do some exploring for an excuse to write another.</p>

<p>For those not familiar with the book "Road Food" or it's companion website, here's some background. </p>

<p>Jane and Michael Stern have traveled the country ump-teen times over the past couple of decades sampling the best food from backroad and Main Street restaurants. The result was "Roadfood" a pretty cool compendium of good eats.</p>

<p>When this guy says a hamburger or tenderloin is good, trust him. He knows his stuff. He also appears weekly on the public radio show <a href="http://www.splendidtable.org">The Splendid Table</a> and is a columnist for Epicurious and Gourmet.</p>

	<h3>Like something from Spirit's camera</h3>

		<h2>01.19.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>"Cool! I want to go tomorrow!"-- Ben, age 5</h3>
	
	<p>They were clumped together by the dozen, hanging from the ceiling hibernating.</p>

<p>Darlene and I went with our friends Caryl and Laura and Laura's two sons to Clifty Falls State Park this afternoon in the sultry 22 degree weather for a hike.</p>

<p>There's a century old railroad tunnel at the park. A guy, who was later Governor of Ohio, tried to build a railroad through Madison, but went bankrupt before he managed to get the thing finished. "Brough's Folly" has left behind a few interesting artifacts including the incomplete tunnel through the canyon bluffs of Clifty Creek.</p>

<p>The entrance has several underground creeks running nearby so the ceiling of the tunnel was covered with icicle stalactites.</p>

<p>Somehow we managed to convince the two boys, the oldest of whom is 5, to go through the tunnel. They were a bit scared at first, but I encouraged them by showing them all the fun things in there.</p>

<p>I held Ben's hand while Caryl took younger Alex and we walked them through over the rocks that have fallen over the decades and trying to avoid the standing water on the bottom of the tunnel.</p>

<p>At one place, the whole ceiling fell out and with our good flashlight you could see a couple dozen feet into the hole above us.</p>

<p>Then there's the underground creek that carved a crevice in the ceiling. There was a waterfall there today and the wall was encrusted with iron deposits. That was cool, but showing them the big spiders in the crevice evenly spaced every six inches was "Cool!!"</p>

<p>Ben wanted to turn back, but I encouraged him to go just a little further so he could see my favorite part of the tunnel in the winter. He grudingly agreed.</p>

<p>Fortunately, soon we were able to see either side of the tunnel and that encouraged him.</p>

<p>We got about halfway when we found them, probably 100 or so bats hibernating in clumps of 4 to 40 bats each.</p>

<p>Ben's first reaction was "aargh! bats!" But I shined my light at them and showed him how they were furry with cat-like ears. "Aren't they cute Ben?" "Awww, yeah..."</p>

<p>He then took the flashlight and searched the ceiling and walls for more. "There's some and there some."</p>

<p>Boy, it's fun when you can get a kid whose scared of something and turn them into a big fan. "Boy this is fun!" I helped him climb over huge boulders on the other side. He was a real trooper.</p>

<p>Their mom is due with the third brother in April, so we promised that we'd take the boys playing some more this spring.</p>

<p><b>Whenever I think of bats (rated PG-13 parental discretion is advised).</b></p>

<p>I had a blast, but whenever I think of bats, I can't help to think about the book "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas." </p>

<p>I've never read the book, but an old friend once did a radio show where he played "road trip music" and between tunes read from books about road trips. He read a passage where the main characters are having to cover some sort of event in Las Vegas, but en route decided to go to LA and buy huge quantities of drugs and take them all en route to LV. After a ungodly dose of ether, the protagonist (if you want to call him that) starts to hallucinate.</p>

<blockquote>"We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold. I remember saying something like "I feel a bit lightheaded; maybe you should drive ..." And suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats, all swooping and screeching and diving around the car, which was going about a hundred miles an hour with the top down to Las Vegas. And a voice was screaming: "Holy Jesus! What are these goddam animals?"
 Then it was quiet again. My attorney had taken his shirt off and was pouring beer on his chest, to facitate the the tanning process. "What the hell are you yelling about?" he muttered, staring up at the sun with his eyes closed and covered with wraparound Spanish sunglasses. "Never mind", I said. "It's your turn to drive."I hit the brakes and aimed the Great Red Shark toward the shoulder of the highway. No point mentioning those bats, I thought. The poor bastard will see them soon enough.</blockquote>

	<h3>534,000 cubic feet per second and -10F</h3>
	
	<p>Boy is it cold tonight. We're looking to bottom out at 4F with wind chill of -10F. Darlene and I pledged to walk after work and we only got down to the river and back (four blocks).</p>

<p>As frigid as it was, it was worth the walk, because our river is moving and fast. All the rain and snow that socked the Northeast and Midwest is flowing past the foot of our street.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="http://www.crh.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ahps.cgi?LMK&clfi3">National Weather Service</a> the Ohio River is flowing by our street at a rate of 534,000 cubic feet per second. The river is wild and as wide as a lake.</p>

<p>The river depth this morning was observed at 44.4 ft and was forecast to peak at 45.2 feet. Observing the line of grunge left behind, it looked as if it had just peaked when we were down there this evening.</p>

<p>Another foot or so and it would have covered some low lying roads. The river gets this high at least once every other year.</p>

<p>Normality? Normal depth around 20 feet and the historic average flow for January is 147,000 ft3/s.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, our apartment is staying moderately comfortable. We are wearing sweat jackets, but at least we're not cold. Putting plastic over our windows is paying off. The studio however is freezing between heating cycles.</p>

	<h3>Tall Stacks</h3>
	
	<p><strong>Riverboats in town</strong></p>

<p>It's fun when we have a riverboat in town. Today we had two--the Delta Queen and the Mississippi Queen. The Mississippi Queen docked with her platform on our city's boat ramp and the Delta placed her ramp on the Mississippi. Darlene went down and snapped some photos and I hope to post one this weekend.</p>

<p>Things happen when the boats come. You can't buy a newspaper anywhere because the "boat people" snag them all. They come to the library to check their email. A number of them also stopped by the studio to watch Darlene throw pots. She said we had guests from Utah, Nevada and California.</p>

<p>I'm trying to put the finishing touches on promo material for our historical photo collection.</p>

<p>This is the first post to the new website. I'm trying to con Darlene into writing some entries as well.</p>

	<h3>Main Street is glossy</h3>
	
	<p>Main Street is glossy with a spring rain today. The town looks much nicer wet as our century old brick buildings are washed clean. The colors are simply richer as the clouds alternatively highlight and soften the 400-foot bluffs surrounding our town. </p>

<p>We've seen a lot of rain -- several inches in the past week. The Ohio River has swollen into a running lake nearly flooding Vaughn Drive. It's the first time the river has threatened to overflow its banks since the nasty flood in 1997. While I'm sure the dafodils love the new rain today, but the local humans are ready to dry out a bit. With flowers blooming downtown, we're being teased with spring. We want more. You bet we want more.</p>
