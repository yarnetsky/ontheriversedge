	<h3>Wireless at the library</h3>
	
	<p>The pieces for our library's wireless puzzle are finally coming together. We had our wireless gateway and one of four access points installed on Sunday. Wednesday night some more will be installed.</p>

<p>I spent all day Sunday and most of today working out the bugs and a few more remain. The building's wiring leaves something to be desired as we have to put some of our staff computers on the gateway as well as the wireless and public machines (grumble, grumble). </p>

<p>As a result, we have to log all those machines into the system every morning to get Internet on those machines. It's either that or each user has to log in and lord forbid if they should accidentally log themselves out by closing a pop-up "logout window".  The director doesn't seem to feel this will be a big deal, but I'm waiting for the wails of pain.</p>

<p>Yet, the system is rather advanced. Login is actually pretty easy. When you first try to go to a website, our server takes you to a login page where we get to explain the rules and tell you who sponsors the service. From there you go to our library website and then you are free to surf. People will even be able to roam the library with a laptop and not have to log into each access point. I think it'll be a pretty slick system once it's all in place. Stop by in a week or so for a surf-- it should be on fro 7 a.m.-9:30 p.m. daily.</p>

	<h3>URLs for trash</h3>
	
	<p>A tidbit I found on LISnews. Apparently, a Dallas guy paid for the Buffalo city government web address so he could pay his trash bill. Boy, I knew hometown was in a fiscal mess, but this is hilarious (and sad): from the <a title="Buffalo News - Off Main Street " href="http://www.buffalonews.com/editorial/20050227/1059067.asp">Buffalo News</a>.</p>

	<h3>Revenge of the gummie bears</h3>
	
	<p>I'd have to say my favorite treat is chocolate-covered gummie bears from Sweden.  I'm not a huge gummie fan, but there's something about the tangy semi-dark chocolate combined with the soft-fruity gummie bears that does the trick.</p>

<p>I'll get a $1 or $2 worth on special occasions at Mundt's, a local candy store famous for it's fish candy. Darlene bought me some for my birthday.</p>

<p>Well I finally ate a few of them tonight while doing my homework and I am now suffering from a pretty bad chocolate buzz-headache. ooofff.... but boy they were good.</p>

		<h2>02.20.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Snippets for Sunday</h3>
	
	<p><b>Friday was a good day on campus.</b> We finally had a sunny afternoon. Not a cloud in the sky so I took advantage of my lunch break to go for a nice long walk down to the White River and back talking to Darlene on the cell phone until my shoulders got sore (I should have locked my backpack in the library lockers). The campus is pretty barren now, but I'm starting to see the trees. It should be rather pretty come spring.</p>

<p><b>grades</b>: I finally received my first graded assignments back in both classes. It felt really, really good to see "excellent work" and "outstanding" on my first papers. </p>

<p>I have to admit that the concept of graduate school had terrified me. Last summer while I was studying for the GRE, a librarian I know said "Jerry, it's just library school, you'll be fine." OK, now that I'm doing the work I can agree with the statement.</p>

<p><b>Coursework</b>: In cataloging we are moving on to MARC records. I thought I was drowning in rules before. Now I'm really drowning in rules. It'll click in I'm sure.</p>

<p>In collection development we are building a collection development plan and related policies step by step. Those policies should reflect the library and the community it serves. Thus the first step is to create a fictional library and community-- fictional, though connected to reality. This is the fun part. I remember covering the Talawanda schools in Oxford, Ohio, when I worked as a reporter for the public radio station at Miami University. You have the college profs wanting a high-end education for their kids, but the farmers outside of town were paying the lion's share of the property taxes. They definitely butted heads a bit during board meetings. So...how would a library operate in similar circumstances? Thus my fictional library will echo that dicotomy.</p>

<p><b>Speaking of fictional</b>: It amazes me that we still haven't screamed bloody murder that the White House has systematically created propoganda for domestic consumption. The fake newscasts played as real news, the columnists paid to write "real" opinion, federal agencies hawking political agenda and now "Jeff Gannon" a fake reporter asking fake questions in White House press conferences so real reporters are being thrown off track. If this was the Clinton White House the Republicans would have set up five investigations by now. Sheesh. Propoganda simply has no place in our society. If the president has something to say, let him say it loud and clear and be answerable to the press and the public. They are pushing fear and hiding behind fake newstories. It's unethical at best.</p>

<p>grrrrrr [imagine a dog taking the Bush action figure by the collar of his flight suit and shaking it back and forth]</p>

<p><b>From the mouths of kids</b>: There is a six-year-old patron of ours that floors me. I told him about the Danny Dunn series of books, which was one of my favorites at his age. He's been swallowing them whole and sent me a thank you note. A THANK YOU NOTE without as much as a word from his parents. Amazing. Now he won't let anyone else check out his books if I'm on the desk. The last time he checked out a video and some books. The due date on the video was Feb. 23 and the books were due on March 2 so I told him about how the numbers were opposite 2-3 and 3-2. He backed up as in shock and said "Wow, that's a palindrome!" A six-year-old knows what a palindrome is? I can understand him knowing the Latin names for all the dinosaurs but palindromes too?</p>

		<h2>02.16.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>cheers and jeers</h3>
	
	<p>My wife is addicted to her daily dose of <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/user/Bill%20in%20Portland%20Maine">Cheers and Jeers</a> at Dailykos.com.</p>

<p>"Bill in Portland Maine" does a fine job of bringing a smile to my darlin's face. However, sometimes it's the comments that follow that get her rolling on the floor. Here is one comment that did the trick today... it seems so aprapo being a former journalist....</p>

<blockquote>This test only has one question, but it's a very important one.  Please don't answer it without giving it some serious thought. By giving an honest answer you will discover where you  stand morally. The test features an unlikely, completely fictional situation, in which you will have to make a decision.

<p>You're in Florida...In Miami, to be exact... There is chaos around you, caused by a  hurricane and severe floods. This is a flood of major proportions. You are a photojournalist  working for a major newspaper caught in the middle of this great disaster. The situation is  nearly hopeless.</p>

<p> You're trying to shoot  career-making photos. There are houses and people swirling around you, some disappearing under  the water. Nature is  showing all its' destructive fury. You see a man in the water. He is fighting for his life, trying not to be taken away with the water and debris. You move closer.</p>

<p>Somehow the man looks familiar. Suddenly, you know who it is... it's George W. Bush! At the same time you notice  that the raging waters are about to take him  under, forever. You have two options. You can save him or you can take the  most dramatic photos of your life. You can save the life of George W.  Bush, or you can shoot a Pulitzer Prize-winning photo, documenting the death of one of the world's most powerful men.</p>

<p> Now, here's the  question (and please give an honest answer):</p>

<p> Would you select color film, or rather go with the classic simplicity of black and  white?</blockquote></p>

<p>Darlene was reading me this one out loud and I was about to say save him because I didn't want Cheney as president. Of course, that was before Darlene told me the punchline.</p>

<p>I remember one time saying I hated Bush. He was lying through his teeth about one thing or another and I was mad as a hornet. But I'm getting better about that kind of thing. I'm studying to be a librarian and it is basically in our ethics that we'll serve anyone. I'd even help Karl Rove research whether Hillary Clinton is really an alien from a planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse.</p>

<p>Actually it was from today's Cheers and Jeers that Bill in Portland stated my thoughts about Bush well:</p>

<blockquote>"I don't really hate George W. Bush.  I just think the President of the United States ought to be able to pass a 5th-grade social studies test.  And not break everything he touches.  And not throw the tax dollars I give him down a sinkhole of debt.  And not toss me and my partner into the snapping jaws of the Bible-thumpers.  And not hire media whores.  And not require loyalty oaths.  And not lie.  And not lie.  And not lie..."

<p>---Bill in Portland Maine.</blockquote></p>

<p>I personally don't blame Bill and his partner Michael for being fearful of "Bible-thumpers." Our society has become rather less respectful of fellow human beings. I truly do not believe Jesus would treat gays as lepers, especially considering how well he treated lepers to begin with. Fortunately, most people I know don't thump their Bibles, but rather read the Good Book with care.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Darlene found another tidbit in today's Cheers and Jeers.</p>

<blockquote>CHEERS To HATE, as in "I hate that m* f* George W. Bush and all that he stands for, and I hate his entire administration, and all of his supporters, and all of his apologists.  And oh yeah, I also hate the Republican party. Because I know what they are all about: stealing from the poor to give to the rich, and bigotry and hypocrisy and lies lies lies."

<p>JEERS To HATE, as in "I hate people of different races, creeds, classes and orientations.  Because I never bothered to find out what they are all about and since they are different than me, they must be evil."</p>

<p>There are two different flavors of hate: blind and justified.  </p>

<p>by Billy Shears on Wed Feb 16th, 2005 at 10:06:03 PST</blockquote></p>

<p>Interesting. </p>

<p>If you're curious, the <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/2/16/105234/586">whole thread</a> on hate started when a columnist called Dailykos something akin to a seething pot of hate toward Bush and Republicans.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that Dailykos does not believe in censors. It's not raunchy, but the "f" word flies around.</p>

	<h3>Unshelved</h3>
	
	<p>Darlene had ordered me the latest collection of Unshelved comic strips for my birthday, but it didn't show up. </p>

<p>So she emailed Bill Barnes (half of the team that creates the daily strip) and asked about the delivery. He wrote back that the payment hadn't been received and that it'll ship when it's received.</p>

<p>Then a little later he wrote back, apologizing profusely. The envelope ended up with his personal mail instead of the business mail and (like all of us) hadn't gone through it.</p>

<p>Today he sent another email that the book was in the mail and that for goofing they tossed in a free baseball cap! Darlene was just glad to hear the check didn't get lost and they kick in a free gift.</p>

<p>Library folks are classy folks, it just goes to show.</p>

<p>Send the guys a little love and subscribe to the comic strip, put a link on your website and/or buy some of the fun stuff they have in their store (I have a library raid t-shirt). If you work in a library or love libraries, it's a fun read.</p>

	<h3>One grade in</h3>
	
	<p>I received my first grade of grad school. It was only an exercise worth a 1/10 of my final grade, but it was graded nonetheless. The exercise was in my bibliographic access and control class-- questions about definitions we needed to know and transcribing features from title pages into the proper format for bibliographic records. </p>

<p>FWIW I got a 9.9 out of 10 -- 90 more points to go. Back to work, I'm working on the follow-up exercise now.</p>

	<h3>Another bill in the "what the..." category</h3>
	
	<p>I wish my blogging software had a subcategory feature. I'd create one just for all the bizarre bills being passed by Congress. Here's the latest...</p>

<p>The new <a href="http://www.house.gov/sensenbrenner/wc20050127.html">"Real ID Act"</a> passed the House and is on the way to the Senate. I don't know enough to debate the proposed immigration and drivers license rules.</p>

<p>However, buried in language "intended" to allow construction of a San Diego border security fence are rules that would allow the homeland security chief to <b>suspend all laws</b> and void judicial review of those violations. Following the links from <a thref="http://www.prospect.org/weblog/archives/2005/02/index.html#005449">TAPPED</a> will give you more details.</p>

		<h2>02.11.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Just when you think you've seen it all</h3>
	
	<p>Haven't you always wondered what the Bush administration was blacking out in the 9-11 Commission Reports? Things they claimed had to stay secret for "national security"? The reasons they held the reports until after the election?</p>

<p>Check out the Dailykos's take on the matter of the <a title="Daily Kos :: FAA Daily Intelligence Reports Identified al-Qaeda Threat" href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/2/11/17138/2221">FAA daily intelligence reports identifying al-Qaeda Threat</a>.</p>

<p>Daily Kos is indeed becoming a very interesting place. Not all blogging is journalism (mine certainly is not), but there's crew of diarists at dkos creating what could be considered open source-investigative journalism. The latest example is the "outting" of a "journalist" all but hired by the White House to protect the president's butt in press conferences? <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/2/10/224122/709">Read all about it</a>.</p>

	<h3>Entry #321: It's a Happy Birthday</h3>
	
	<p>Well, in two years, I could wear a black arm band and mourn. I'm taking the day off from everything, just kicking around the house with my Darlin'.</p>

<p>Darlene bought me a gift certificate to the Apple iTunes store. She was amazed you can find them at our downtown grocery store. I got myself a bunch of 80s music-- the Go-Gos (yes, they did do some cool tunes), Marshall Crenshaw, Psychadelic Furs, Split Enz, Supertramp and for the fun of it Petula Clark's "Downtown." Slowly but surely I'm collecting all the music I listened to in high school and college.  I need to listen to the radio more often so I can here some new music. I just never have the opportunity. I could probably listen to WTTS out of Bloomington on the way to Indy, but I'm now stuck in podcats.</p>

<p>My email inbox was full of birthday cards. They were all great, but I think my favorite was set in outer space with the Star Wars theme playing in the background with words moving across the screen.... "Forget about the past, you can't change it..... forget about the future, you can't predict it..... forget about the present, I didn't get you one."  I was rolling on bed laughing.</p>

<p>My mom, meanwhile, was sneaky. She brought my present down when she visited for New Year's and Darlene hid it for her ever since. It's a gorgeous book... "The Most Beautiful Libraries in the World." The Italian libraries, such as the Vatican Library, seem to be more about the structure and the frescos than the books, but the French and British libraries are beautiful...you just want to sit in them and study for hours on end. I loved the New York Public Library photos and the Library of Congress reading room is amazing (though I was disappointed that they didn't show the stacks, boring in comparison?)</p>

<p>We're finishing the evening by watching Hayao Miyazaki's "Castle in the Sky." We'll probably have to finish it tomorrow, but boy his work is awesome. <a href="http://disney.go.com/disneyvideos/animatedfilms/miyazaki/index2.html">Check it out</a> if you can.<br />

		<h2>02.06.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>No time this time, no time at all</h3>
	
	<p>Admittedly it's only been a month in grad school, but so far I'm enjoying the homework, reading, etc. It feels good to do something constructive. Getting my brain to think is a good thing (as Martha would say...)<br />
 <br />
Yet, I'm already finding I have to deprive myself of a few luxuries. For example, when I see one of my favorite mysteries show up in the new books shelf... I can't read it. I need to do homework.</p>

<p>When I see something that drives me crazy, I don't have time to go tracking down all the links so no one thinks I'm making these crazy things up. For example, there's a bill being introduced that could give the secretary of homeland security the ability to bypass any law on the books with no review. </p>

<p>For those needing their fix on progressive politics, I'll try to add some more good political links. Outside of those links I suspect my political rants will be linkless.</p>

<p>Heck, I bought the new Adobe Creative Suite software and haven't even touched it yet. Darlene wanted to know what I wanted for my birthday and my first thought was Apple's new iWork, but who has time for it? Now you know it's desperate times.</p>

<p>Well, I'd better get used to it. I still have 23 more months to go.</p>

		<h2>02.03.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>We have a kiln room!</h3>
	
	<p>After long wait, Darlene finally has a kiln room to call her own! </p>

<p>For the past 18 months Darlene has shoehorned in her glazing and kilns into a room the size of a walk-in closet. A couple of times she was forced to glaze at the same time the kiln was running. Obviously the room was hot as hell. She quit that practice entirely when her arm barely bumped up against the kiln when it was around 1000F (not half the top temperature, but painful nonetheless).</p>

<p>Another room was available for use in our warehouse, but in order to liberate it we first had to finish the second floor of our warehouse (insulation, new flooring, drywall, etc). When we bought the building the warehouse roof was completely rotted through as was the flooring below. After displacing many a mushroom it is finally ready for use -- and we get our kiln room.</p>

<p>There will be enough room for three kilns and we'll more than double our firing capacity. Finally we'll get a decent number of pots through.</p>

<p>Grad school week four is tomorrow. It's Thursday night already? Where has this week flown? Making time to study has been harder than I thought, but I'm finding more of it as I get the distractions shoved aside. It sounds odd, but once I get into it, doing homework is almost peaceful. If you hear me say that as I prepare for my mid-term exam then you'll know I'm in deep.</p>

		<h2>02.01.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Statistical liars</h3>
	
	<p>My view of the Social Security debate is whether or not we want the United States to be what the administration calls an "ownership society."</p>

<p>Based on the proposals I'm hearing, such as the elimination of employer paid health insurance, it'd be more of an "on your own" society where only the rich would have access to any kind of decent health care or retirement. (For the average American, the so-called medical saving accounts they outline would be wiped out by a single hospital stay).</p>

<p>Either way, Paul Krugman in his recent column points out that the administration, in effort to prove its point, is having a little too much fun with the Social Security numbers. </p>

<p>In essence if we take the assumptions used that the stock market would give great returns for retirement and used the same numbers to Social Security, than SS would be just fine.</p>

<h4>what.</h4>
<ul><li>This is a journal of our life, culture, libraries, the Apple Macintosh, progressive politics, and of course historic Madison, Indiana, the most beautiful rivertown in America.</li></ul>

<h4>who.</h4> 

<ul><li>G'day, I'm E.G. Yarnetsky and I answer questions at our local library. I'm preparing to go to grad school in January. I'm a former journalist who still dabbles in design work. My wife's a potter who makes beautiful functional and sculptural ceramics.</li></ul>
