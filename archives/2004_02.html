	<h3>Movable Type delivers visitors?</h3>
	
	<p>For some reason, I decided to look at my site stats. I'm hosted on 1and1.com. I couldn't resist the three-years free offer. It serves me well, but the control panel is still on the slow side so I don't mess with it often.</p>

<p>Today I did and I'm shocked. The traffic to this site has climbed nearly 400 percent two straight months. </p>

<p>I was getting 200-300 unique visitors a month late last year when I was using Blogger. I switched to Movable Type this year and my "circulation" jumped to 800 in January and nearly 2,000 in February.</p>

<p>I attribute this climb to two things. </p>

<p>First I believe I can write a decent headline.</p>

<p>I'm a former journalist with 15 years under my wing. After I left my last newspaper job I quit writing for nearly a year. This blog was an effort to reactivate the muse (as well as letting my mom and family know what's going on in our lives.) </p>

<p>While my writing is slowing improving, I think some of my entries are catching blog readers eyes due to my headlines. The entry "I love CSS, I hate CSS and boy it's cold" spiked my daily readership from an average of 70 to nearly 300. The entry was only about my struggle to learn CSS. Pretty boring actually, thus I can only attribute it to the headline. An entry on Howard Dean similarly tripled my readership.</p>

<p>Second is the pings built into the Movable Type software. Apparently it works. But I'm still amazed that 2,000 have visited in Feburary.</p>

<p>Leave a comment occasionally and say hi. Let me know what you'd like to read. </p>

	<h3>Duck, Duck, Egyptian Goose?</h3>
	
	<p>We definitely have been enjoying the milder weather. I'm biking to work again and Darlene's out walking the riverfront daily. After a said walk, she reported to me there was a pretty neat bird skulking along with our local flock of mallards, Canada geese and other domestic fowl that like hanging out where people toss free food.</p>

<p>As it hit 60 today, we took the camera for some birding. Lo and behold, there was a pretty neat bird sitting on the banks of the Ohio.</p>

<p><img alt="Egyptian goose" src="http://www.ontheriversedge.com/archives/egyptian.jpg" border="0" /></p>

<p>What's weird however, is this bird, an <a href="http://www.zoo.org/educate/fact_sheets/savana/egoose.htm">Egyptian Goose</a>, does not belong here. It's not even in a migratory pattern through here. It's supposed to be living in the Nile valley, the sub-Sahara or Western Europe. While common in Africa, it's a sacred bird in Egypt.</p>

<p>Where this Egyptian Goose came from is anyone's guess. There's good odds it has escaped from a zoo or private collection.</p>

<p>Maybe he's slowly working its way down the Ohio to Cairo, Ill., thinking its heading to Cairo, Egypt, on the Nile.</p>

<p>Hey, it's name starts with my initials and we found it "on the rivers edge" so for now he's my website mascot.</p>

	<h3>Another day</h3>
	
	<p>Can't say I've been in the mood to blog lately, though I can't for say why at the moment.</p>

<p>We're busy at the library. I'm trying to get the March-April library newsletter together. Photography, Arbor Day activities (a whole month worth of tree stuff actually), our biannual a prose and poetry reading, a gourd program, tax help and "much, much more!"</p>

<p>Darlene is getting a bit more sunshine of late and I'm able to bike to work again. Temperatures are trending toward highs of 40s and we'll hit upper 50s this weekend. I can deal with that.</p>

<p>We're talking about the future with a capital F. We've come to the conclusion that it's a matter of being able to make actual choices as opposed to being forced to settle for the default. </p>

<p>While some of the possible choices have instilled a sense of fear at the boundaries of one's mind and spirit, I think any of the choices will force us out of our comfort zone and force us to grow. </p>

<p>It seems as we're starting to make those choices this century. We finally bought a building. I started a new job, possibly a new career. Darlene finally has her <i>own</i> studio.</p>

<p>Life's a highway. It's just a matter of avoiding the same fast food restaurants at each exit. Take care all.</p>

	<h3>Humans Failing the Turing Test</h3>
	
	<p>Mathematician Alan Turing predicted that when a computer sending text messages could fool humans into thinking they were dealing with another human, that the machine could be called "intelligent."</p>

<p>The BBC website published a rather interesting <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3503465.stm">article</a> on the topic. </p>

<p>The article reminded me of an email that I recently received and thought was from a friend. I opened it and it turned out to be machine generated spam. As the article explains, for a split second, I was fooled by a machine.</p>

<p>But, can you imagine a guy trying for 13 days to get a computer to go on a virtual date with him? <a href="http://foner.www.media.mit.edu/people/foner/Julia/section3_3.html">It's happened.</a></p>

	<h3>Addicted to Love</h3>
	
	<p>For those madly in love, I offer up this article from <a title="Economist.com" href="http://www.economist.com/printedition/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Story_ID=2424049">Economist.com</a>.<br />
<blockquote>In 2000, Andreas Bartels and Semir Zeki of University College, London, located the areas of the brain activated by romantic love. They took students who said they were madly in love, put them into a brain scanner, and looked at their patterns of brain activity.</p>

<p>The results were surprising. For a start, a relatively small area of the human brain is active in love, compared with that involved in, say, ordinary friendship. �It is fascinating to reflect�, the pair conclude, �that the face that launched a thousand ships should have done so through such a limited expanse of cortex.� The second surprise was that the brain areas active in love are different from the areas activated in other emotional states, such as fear and anger. Parts of the brain that are love-bitten include the one responsible for gut feelings, and the ones which generate the euphoria induced by drugs such as cocaine. So the brains of people deeply in love do not look like those of people experiencing strong emotions, but instead like those of people snorting coke. Love, in other words, uses the neural mechanisms that are activated during the process of addiction. �We are literally addicted to love,� Dr Young observes.</blockquote><br />
No wonder breaking up is so horrible. You suffer withdrawl.</p>

	<h3>Took a birthday break</h3>
	
	<p>I realized I hadn't posted in several days. I guess that's what happens when you're having too much fun. My birthday was Tuesday, turned a young pup 37.</p>

<p>It was a lot of fun. Everyone was spoiling me with cards, phone calls, a basket of fruit, an Apple iTunes Music Store gift certificate and 8 hours of pre-recorded Star Trek, along with assorted movies and music.</p>

<p>Obviously Darlene and I spent our last few nights watching Star Trek.</p>

<p>The iTunes Music Store could be dangerous. I had a ton of fun picking them out, but the download is slow I had to leave the modem running overnight to download the 19 songs. I'm in trouble if I ever get broadband Internet.</p>

<p>For the curious, here are the iTunes I bought. Mostly tunes I remembered from the 70s and 80s that I can't get locally.</p>
	
	<p>"Classical Gas" by Mason Williams<br />
"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic" by The Police<br />
"Fortress around Your Heart" by Sting<br />
"Hold Back the Rain" by Duran Duran<br />
"I Still Believe (Great Design)" by The Call<br />
"In Your Eyes" by Peter Gabriel<br />
"Last Night of the World" by Bruce Cockburn<br />
"Layla" by Derek & The Dominos<br />
"Lovers In a Dangerous Time" by Bruce Cockburn		<br />
"Mystery Man" The Outfield<br />
"Night Train" by Bruce Cockburn<br />
"Owner of a Lonely Heart" by Yes<br />
"Say It Isn't So" by The Outfield<br />
"Shine a Little Love" by Electric Light Orchestra<br />
"Since You're Gone" by The Cars<br />
"Since You've Been Gone" by The Outfield<br />
"Synchronicity 2" by The Police	<br />
"Valerie" by Steve Winwood<br />
"Your Love" by The Outfield</p>

<p>It's funny that the Cars and the Outfield tunes have nearly the same name. I didn't notice that until just now.</p>

	<p>Amazon.com in Canada had a glitch that revealed the true names of anonymous review posters. Their true identities are amazing. There's a whole marketing and anti-marketing war going on according to this <a title="Amazon Glitch Unmasks War of Reviewers" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/14/technology/14AMAZ.html?hp=&pagewanted=all&position=">New York Times artice.</a><br />

	<h3>New York Donkeys don't like Bush</h3>
	
	<p>Being a New Yorker by birth, I follow the state's politics. According to a <a href="http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x10127.xml">Quinnipiac University poll</a> released yesterday, Bush is a sure loser in that state. </p>

<p>Even though Democrats out-register Republicans 5:3, GOP candidates are regularly elected state-wide. Republicans in the state had some hope Bush could pull off a win in the state based on his handling of 9-11. </p>

<p>But this poll sheds a lot of doubt. Of Democrats polled, 88 percent said they'd vote for John Kerry. That's not many Democrats for crossover voting.</p>

<p>Indeed, the president has very high negatives among Democrats. According to the poll, 6% admire the president, 14% are satisfied with his performance, 42 percent are dissatisfied and 35% are "angry" at the president. 43% of whites are "angry" and 41% of union households.</p>

<p>Apparently there are not many Reagan Democrats left in the state.</p>

	<h3>Text mssgng poems...in Scotland</h3>
	
	<p>The Scottish Poetry Library has a fun concept. They commissioned six of Scotland's best poets to create mini-poems for Valentine's Day.</p>

<p>Then are now offering to text message these poems to your Scottish sweety for a pound fifty.</p>

<p>Now if you only had a sweetie in Scotland that had a text messaging capable cell-phone you'd be in good shape.</p>

<p>Here's one of the poems by Edwin Morgan:</p>

<blockquote>Kiss me with rain on your eyelashes,
come on, let us sway together,
under the trees, and to hell with thunder.</blockquote>

	<h3>Toasty Oven</h3>
	
	<p>After months of waiting, we have a rudementary kitchen again. </p>

<p>We still don't have water, but we now have an oven and a microwave again. Admittedly we have to unplug the refrigerator to use either.</p>

<p>We love being able to eat fish again and baked a pizza and some cinnamon rolls. Boy I've missed having an oven.</p>

<p>The microwave meanwhile cooks things twice as fast as the 15-year-old model that caught fire last month. </p>

<p>It's amazing that we paid the same amount for this one as we did 15 years ago.</p>

	<h3>I'm a published restaurant critic</h3>
	
	<p>When Darlene's sister's family came to visit, we all descended on <a title="Mundt's Candies" href="http://www.mundtscandies.com">Mundt's Candies</a> here in downtown Madison. I know the owner, Maryanne Imes, but the gang had such a good time that I wrote up a review so others could enjoy this awesome place. </p>

<p>Read my first <a title="Roadfood.com" href="http://www.roadfood.com/Reviews/Writeup.aspx?ReviewID=2026&RefID=1962">Roadfood.com review</a>. I had a lot of fun writing it. I may do some exploring for an excuse to write another.</p>

<p>For those not familiar with the book "Road Food" or it's companion website, here's some background. </p>

<p>Jane and Michael Stern have traveled the country ump-teen times over the past couple of decades sampling the best food from backroad and Main Street restaurants. The result was "Roadfood" a pretty cool compendium of good eats.</p>

<p>When this guy says a hamburger or tenderloin is good, trust him. He knows his stuff. He also appears weekly on the public radio show <a href="http://www.splendidtable.org">The Splendid Table</a> and is a columnist for Epicurious and Gourmet.</p>

	<h3>Dinnerworks</h3>
	
	<p>Darlene and I visited Louisville yesterday and included the <a href="http://www.louisvillevisualart.org/annual_events/Dinnerworks/DinnerWorks%202004/dinnerworks_2004.htm">Dinnerworks exhibit</a> at the Louisville Visual Arts Association Watertower Gallery. </p>

<p>The concept is to take handmade dinnerware by potters, glass makers or metal workers and give them over to designers who create whimsical table settings. This year, my favorite was a table setting you'd find out in the woods with place settings for cartoon characters. Last year, they had a table setting for a covert meeting of World War II political leaders to debate the future of the war.</p>

<p>Some of the dinnerware is absolutely beautiful, most of it pottery (thus Darlene is in her element drooling and pawing at the pots).</p>

<p>Last year's was better overall, but the exhibit is delightful nonetheless. Well worth the $3 ticket.</p>

	<h3>Bad library joke</h3>
	
	<p>For the first time, everyone in the library now has their individual emails. To give us incentive to check it, our director promised to send along a joke now and then. Here's the first joke:</p>

<blockquote>One day a librarian sees a chicken walk up to her desk and
cluck, "book-book-book- BOOOOOK." She follows the chicken while it pecks at six books and pulls out a library card.

<p>The next week the whole sequence happens again, and the curious librarian follows the chicken to see where it's going with all these books. She follows it to a pond, where the chicken gives the books to a frog, who glances at the titles and throws them aside, saying "readdit! readdit! readdit!"</blockquote></p>

		<h2>02.02.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Media finally admits it was wrong about Dean</h3>
	
	<p>Dianne Sawyer, one of the TV folks who played Dean's "scream" speech more than 700 times, has written an <a href "http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/news/wabc_2004vote_012904dean.html">article</a> which essentially said what I wrote a couple weeks ago. </p>

<p>She wrote in her analysis that Dean was yelling to be heard over a roaring crowd. Because of his special noise-cancelling microphone, TV viewers didn't hear the crowd and the cameras did not show the crowd either.</p>

<p>Journalism isn't a science and people make mistakes. I've certainly made mistakes in my time on the beat. But geesh, as an industry this one was bad. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the mea culpa is way too late. The damage is done. Millions saw the tapes. Thousands might see the clarification. </p>

<p>The Dean campaign made it's own mistakes. During Iowa, he lost his message. Their TV ads were mediocre and he should not have gotten into an attack war with Gephardt. But if the "scream" was reported fairly, with the "roaring" crowd putting it into context, Dean could have won New Hampshire.</p>

<p>I'll admit to being biased. Originally, I liked Kerry. But soon his campaign suffered from Gore syndrome-- over consulted. </p>

<p>Dean wasn't the perfect candidate. He definitely had the "doctor" arrogance. But once you understood that, the vibrancy he brought to the campaign was beyond imagine. It was exciting:<br />
<ul><li>Getting $40million from a huge number of small dollar donors. This in a party the Clintons got addicted to soft money to the point is didn't know how to raise hard money.</li> <br />
<li>Utilizing strategies originally used during the Civil Rights Movement to motivate and mobilize grassroots voters on the ground in New Hampshire.</li><br />
<li>Utilizing the Internet to coordinate huge numbers of supporters and for fundraising.</li><br />
<li>Getting the Democratic Party out of its shellshock to once again be the loyal (and patriotic) opposition.</li><br />
<li>Bringing issues such as realistic health care reform to the forefront.</li><br />
<li>Talking fiscal conservatism in an era when the president is breaking the bank with lopsided tax cuts and multi-billion dollar supplemental budgets.</li><br />
</ul><br />
For all these reasons and more, Dean is owed a huge thanks from Democrats (if not from the whole country). The other Democratic candidates are stealing his lines and the party in general has restored it's collective backbone. If the Democrats win in November. They have Dean to thank.</p>

<p>Want more proof of Dean's mark on the current political debate? </p>

<p>All of the sudden, with admitted encouragement from disgusted conservatives in his own party, the president is talking cutting the deficit in half in five years and is cutting back on many of his own proposals. Similarly, he's talking up his own health care initiatives. But that's another post.</p>

	<h3>I gave up</h3>
	
	<p>so I tried something else fun with CSS. Basically the new webpage has two photos overlaying each other and I get to choose where each peeks out, the original or the "frosted glass" version. The photo is the Ohio River bridge at Madison.</p>

<p>It's a tad gaudy at this point. I'll try to find a photo of something a little less eye-boggling.</p>

	<h3>It figures</h3>
	
	<p>I'm not sure why I'm bothering to learn CSS, nor why I'm getting obsessive in getting this three column layout to work. But leave it to a windows machine to blow my hard work out of the water. On Mac it's looking pretty darn good. On Microsoft's browser it looks awful. Go figure. I'll have to see what it looks like in Mozilla on windows.<br />
