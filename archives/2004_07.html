	<h3>I'm jazzed. Hope truly is on the way</h3>
	
	<p>Just finished watching the Kerry speech on the net and I'm jazzed.</p>

<p>As far as sheer speech making goes, it didn't hold a candle to Barak Obama's awesome keynote address. But for John Kerry it was just perfect. (<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A25678-2004Jul29.html">read it</a>|<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/mmedia/politics/072904-27v.htm">watch it</a>)</p>

<p>I was impressed with how absolutely ingenious his entry to the speech was: "I'm John Kerry and I'm reporting for duty." </p>

<p>Right there everything that has been said in the prior days in the convention had been wrapped up in a single phrase. Right there, patriotism and the urge to serve is fulfilled.</p>

<p>The speech itself was surprising. Kerry, strongly defended about any weakness you could imagine the Democratic Party having. "Oh, they're a party of the '60s.'" Yes, Kerry said and through it we provided civil rights, voting rights, womens rights and we're back to finish the job. He always brought it back to the future and hope for the future.</p>

<p>And my did he slam the Bush adminstration. </p>

<blockquote>"I will be a commander in chief who will never mislead us into war. I will have a vice president who will not conduct secret meetings with polluters to rewrite our environmental laws. I will have a secretary of defense who will listen to the best advice of the military leaders.� And I will appoint an attorney general who will uphold the Constitution of the United States."</blockquote>

<p>Amen. The opening has been played in the chess match. This will be interesting.</p>

	<h3>BBC does TV right</h3>
	
	<p>Recently, surfing the Internet has been like visiting Louisville. We visit the same haunts over and over and shut ourselves off from discovering something new.</p>

<p>The last few trips to Louisville we've tried new things and it's been fun. Similarly, I decided to branch out my surfing a bit last night. </p>

<p>My favorite find was the BBC's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/doctorwho/">Doctor Who</a> website. It was awesome. I haven't been able to watch the British television show for years so the website is a welcome fix.</p>

<p>My favorite feature are their <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/doctorwho/webcasts/index.shtml">webcast episodes</a>. Think of them as twist between a comic book and a radio show. With the Real1 player, the episodes work best on a 56K modem or higher speed.</p>

<p>The BBC's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/">Cult Television</a> site covers all the favorites from the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy to the Thunderbirds. It features lots of multimedia content and feature articles.</p>

<p>The best piece of news I discovered was BBC is producing a <a href="http://www.abovethetitle.com/content/programmes/hitchhikers/hitchhikers.html">a new radio series</a> based on the Douglas Adams' book "Life, the Universe and Everything." It is scheduled for broadcast this September and October. I wonder if it will be available over the net or via shortwave? </p>

<p>Similarly, the final two books will also be created into radio shows. The entire cast will return for the three series which the notable exception of the late Peter Jones who starred as "the book."</p>

		<h2>07.23.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Fair was a success</h3>
	
	<p>We survived the Jefferson County 4-H Fair in one piece. Other than needing to get the talking points out to everyone things worked rather well for our first time out.</p>

<p>The biggest hit was our Accu-Cut puzzles. We printed out 4 per page flyers that said "Puzzled? Come to the Library for Answers." We used that as a talking point with the kids and parents. We then had them drawing pictures on the back. I hammed it up with the kids. I had them say magical words "ugily, buggily, boo!" and roled the puzzle through the cutter "and poof, you have a puzzle."</p>

<p>However, I suspect that free-form drawing is becoming a lost art as a number of kids were dumbstruck with the concept. I continued hamming it up and made suggestions to get their brains going. "You can draw cars, balloons, sheep, horses, hearts... hey, you could even draw me!" pregnent pause. "No? I guess not." They'd laugh and start drawing something. However, a mother-daughter combo actually took me up on the joke. That was even funnier.</p>

<p>A few days later, Darlene ran into a mother who said her kids were <b>still</b> playing with the puzzles and were even making up games to play with them. So while kids drawing may be a lost art, creativity is not!</p>

<p>I think we managed to have 300 folks doing puzzles over the week.</p>

<p>Our drawing for free books and CDs was a general success as well. We drew 42 winners from more than 340 entries. About half of the winners had picked up their prizes when I left for Ohio yesterday.</p>

<p>For prizes we used the duplicate CDs from the "CD price-fixing" settlement shipment we received earlier this summer. We also used a small number of the books donated to the library that we didn't add to the collection.</p>

<p>It was fun.</p>

	<h3>Still no Net</h3>
	
	<p>Two days later we finally got a call that the cable guys will be in on Wednesday. Fortunately, this weekend I have access to the net at my father-in-law's house. What would I do without my daily dose?</p>

	<h3>A quick question</h3>
	
	<p>As the 9-11 commission recommends <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7335-2004Jul22.html">sweeping changes </a>in our intelligence community in order to compensate for the failings of past administrations (yes, both Republican and Democrat), a question begs to be asked.</p>

<p>How can we trust the Bush administration to make the necessary changes when he isn't <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/september11/story/0,11209,1191687,00.html">willing to acknowledge</a> he did anything wrong to begin with?</p>

	<h3>Living life without a Net</h3>
	
	<p>So this is what it feels like to be without Internet. </p>

<p>We ordered Adelphia High Speed Internet and expected to be connected on Tuesday. At first the cable guy couldn't figure out how to pull it off. </p>

<p>Finally, figured out they had to pull a line from across the street, on top of our warehouse addition and between the walls and down into our basement and finally back up to somewhere on our first floor. </p>

<p>So they said they'd be back with three guys and try it again. When? WHO KNOWS!</p>

<p>Yet, we made the mistake of discontinuing our old provider in order to avoid a $22 charge on our bank account for the month. It saved us money, but now we are living life without a net.</p>

<p>When I'll get to blog again I have not idea. </p>

<p>Live life well and don't do anything I wouldn't do.</p>

	<h3>Forward thinking John E.</h3>
	
	<p>Interesting article from the <a title="washingtonpost.com: Edwards Sets Self Apart on Foreign Policy" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A37644-2004Jul8?language=printer">Washington Post</a> on how John Edwards has had his mind on foreign policy over the past few years.</p>

<p>I found the article courtesy of the Columbia Journalism Review's <a href "http://www.campaigndesk.org/archives/000721.asp">Campaign Desk</a>. It's an echo, but I have to agree that it's nice to see someone in the media actually try to answer the oft-quoted question of whether Edwards is qualified to be a 21st Century VP.</p>

	<h3>New Blogger services</h3>
	
	<p>Here at the library, we use a weblog to keep everyone up to date on new policies, etc. It was free using <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a> and their free hosting service called Blogspot. </p>

<p>I was happy to see their have recently updated their blogging services to include stuff like comments and new templates. To upgrade to the new service, I went to the blog "dashboard" and went to "change settings." I clicked on the "template" settings and "Pick new" and picked a fun new template for our library staff blog.</p>

<p>Good stuff and worth the effort.</p>

	<h3>Sometimes it's hard being a geek...</h3>
	
	<p>Every day, I look through <a href="http://www.macsurfer.com">MacSurfer</a> and gather all the news that's fit to Mac. I'd have bought Apple stock at $8 a share if I had the money (boy do I wish). I own an iBook laptop and enjoys surfing in bed by Wi-Fi. Thus I might as well face it that I'm an <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> geek.</p>

<p>Being an Apple geek is easy. Steve Jobs comes out with fun products that work and you get to make fun of Microsoft too. (Though I'll give Bill Gates tons of credit for giving computers to <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Libraries/">libraries</a>). </p>

<p>No one harasses me for being an Apple geek. Indeed, people are sending people my way at the library to answer Mac questions. Being a geek can be fun.</p>

<p>Yet, as if it wasn't obvious, I'm also among the 28 percent of Americans who are "closely following the election." The extent to which would definitely classifies me as a political geek. For example, I don't follow the national polls. I follow the state polls-- the ones that really matter. Check out <a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com">electoral-vote.com</a>.</p>

<p>But being a political geek in a small town is hard sometimes. </p>

<p>On one hand, I'd love to go campaigning door-to-door for candidates who'll make a difference. I did this once for a city council candidate in Toledo. You really feel like you make connections even if you lose (my candidate won state rep. the following year).</p>

<p>On the other hand, I don't want my politics to interfer with my work or my wife's pottery either. </p>

<p>I want everyone to feel comfortable they can come to me for help finding information. On the flip side, I don't want to be harassed in the library for my views either.</p>

<p>Darlene and I already had a guy from Pennsylvania come into our pottery studio and literally bait us into a political argument.</p>

<p>By speaking out in public (or even putting a Kerry sign in my bedroom window), I fear I'd get more of the same or that my job would be compromised. Sometimes I feel even writing in this blog may cost me somehow in the future.</p>

<p>Yet, sometimes I feel like the call to speak out (and not just blog) overwhelming.</p>

<p>Let me give an example. There's an article in this week's <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5411741/site/newsweek">Newsweek</a> about how the Department of Homeland Security is seriously looking at getting the power from Congress to postpone the elections in case of a terrorist attack.</p>

<p>On the face of it, I find this scary. For the past year, my father-in-law kept saying Bush was going to try cancelling the election. But until he sent me a copy of the article, I just didn't think anyone could think of altering such an integral part of our democracy. Now I'm not so sure. This <b>is</b> the same administration that's pushing the Pakistani government to <a href="http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&sid=aiQyYlkml67U&refer=us">capture or kill top Al-Queda</a> operatives during the first three days of the Democratic National Convention.</p>

<p>I'll withhold judgement until I see the legislation, but I swear if I feel Bush is trying to corrupt the system, I'll be protesting loud and long. At that point I won't care about my reputation.</p>

	<h3>Bush's lucky day</h3>
	
	<p>While I suspect the Republicans are a tad terrified over Kerry picking the popular Edwards as his running mate, Bush actually royally lucked out. </p>

<p>Sean Aday of The Gadflyer writes about <a title="The Gadflyer: Bush's Good Press Day" href="http://gadflyer.com/articles/?ArticleID=160">Bush's Good Press Day</a>... as in what <b>didn't</b> get into the media distracted by Edwards:<br />
<blockquote>So let's review: Cheney lied to the American people and continues to do so; the Administration lied to Congress (and therefore the American people) and threatened an administrator with his job if he squealed; even Tony Blair can't keep lying about WMD; our "values" President thinks some Neanderthal who would probably be more comfortable in a Taliban courtroom than an American one deserves a lifetime appointment to the federal bench; and Iraq is still a unmitigated disaster.</blockquote><br />
Boy he's lucky...</p>

	<h3>At the fair</h3>
	
	<p>It's a Friday at the library which is nice as I can get some work done.</p>

<p>I'll be at the Jefferson County 4-H Fair next week with our assistant director and others representing the library. It could be fun. I created a game of Jefferson County trivia that I hope will be fun for people. I'm working on a simple Powerpoint presentation of some of the photos that's in our <a href="http://madison-jeffco.cdm.oclc.org">photo history website.</a></p>

<p>We'll also have library puzzles for the kids. On one side is a puzzle and on the other side kids can draw a picture. We'll then cut it into an 8-piece puzzle for them. Combine that with general info and I think we'll be busy enough.</p>

<p>I'll miss swimming though as I'll probably be working 1-10 p.m. each day.</p>

<p>A couple more entries and I'll have hit 200. Hmmm. I'll have to make sure it's an interesting one.</p>

	<h3>vacation musings</h3>
	
	<p>It was nice to play tourist for once. We took a trip to Louisville on business actually and went around after we dropped off some pottery for jurying.</p>

<p>Highlights I'd recommend: Gallopaloosa's artistic horse sculptures is a lot of fun. Lexington, Ky., did horses a few years ago, but Louisville's are on the whole better.</p>

<p>Great exhibit at the Kentucky Museum of Art and Design. Two galleries full of pottery. Our favorite was "Splendid Table" pots for food. Lots of pots we'd love to own. "Tea for Two" is of tea sets, but it failed to fulfill the promise of tea sets that would be used in intimate settings between two spouses, friends or lovers. The work just didn't capture the theme.</p>

<p>Wild Oats is a fun natural food store on Shelbyville Road. We finally got to GlassWorks, but it was too late for the tour. At least they didn't charge us to watch the hot glass demonstrations.</p>

<p>Louisville's art scene is hopping. For a gallery guide check out <a href="http://www.looklouisvilleart.com">LOOK</a></p>

<p>I'll add links later. Notes on Cincinnati coming as well.</p>

	<h3>The DaVinci Code</h3>
	
	<p>I finally read The Da Vinci Code during vacation after everyone and their brother told me to read it. After that kind of buzz I expected a lot so on the whole I came away a little disappointed.</p>

<p>The concepts and history interpretations he presented were rather interesting and I loved the puzzles. Yet, as literature it wasn't very good.</p>

<p>It read like a mystery novel wrapped around an academic paper. It used the "cliffhanger" device way too often, author Dan Brown didn't realistically develop the characters and the dialog seemed to exist solely as a way to convey information about his research. Overall it came off as bit sloppy to me.</p>

<p>I started reading it while we were at the Leeper Park Art Fair in South Bend. An English teacher came up and said it was one of her 10 favorite books of all time, but that she was mad at the author because she was a Christian.</p>

<p>I don't know why an English teacher would consider it one of her top 10, but I'm not surprised it made her mad. Unfortunately, the conversation ended before it really got started so I'm not sure what part of the book made her mad-- Jesus as human, the "edited" Bible, how the early church adapted and pilaged the existing religions, goddess worship, etc., etc. I guess any could do the trick.</p>

<p>It didn't really make me "mad" per se. I think part of the reason is I never took the Bible as absolute truth (though it does contain absolute truths). Like Brown, I suspect that books like the Bible don't make it through time unedited. Recent translations have made true efforts to return to the earliest copies, but where are other reports of Jesus' life? Just as Fox News bypasses news of President Bush's foibles, I suspect we're missing details of Jusus' truly astounding life.</p>

<p>That's the end of my thoughts as of now. I'm still thinking.</p>

	<h3>Let me brag on my wife</h3>
	
	<p>For the past five years, Darlene spends the spring working on creating the trophies for the Madison Courier Firecracker 10K Race that's held here every year during the Fourth of July weekend.</p>

<p>For the last four years Clarksville, Ind., runner Amanda Bell has won the women's division and as a result has several of Darlene's sculptures created as the winner's trophey.</p>

<p>Apparently, she is enjoying them...</p>

<blockquote>�I love to come back to Madison. It�s a sentimental race for me and even though I could probably run somewhere else for money, I told my coach he�d just have to deal with it because I�m going to Madison... And the trophies are the best anywhere. They are very unique and very artistic. Most places you run you get a plaque. What can you do with a plaque? Everybody that sees my Courier 10K trophies just loves them. I�ve got them sitting all around and they are my favorite awards.�</blockquote>

<p>Read the rest of the <a title="Madison Courier Daily Newspaper Madison Indiana" href="http://www.madisoncourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=18&SubSectionID=289&ArticleID=18927">article.</a></p>

<p>Here's what this year's trophies look like as Darlene opened the kiln.</p>

	<h3>This is a vacation</h3>
	
	<p>It's hard to believe I'm halfway into my vacation already. But I finally feel like I'm off work.</p>

<p>We did the show in South Bend and it was mediocre. We set an amount in our minds that if we made $xx that we wouldn't be really disappointed. We made that amount plus $6. Oh well. No fluff money, but it pays the bills.</p>

<p>Darlene talked to other artists who said sales are still down across the board. Sales on Main Street here haven't picked up much either. Indeed, the downturn has forced another business to close. </p>

<p>My mom is now visiting for about 12 days. We went to Louisville today to drop off some pots at the <a href="www.kentuckycrafts.org">Kentucky Museum of Art+Design</a> for jurying. We have an outside shot at getting into their museum gallery store. We got a sneak peak at a ceramics exhibit there that's rather nice. We also looked at a lot of street sculpture and saw a glass blowing demo at GlassWorks. A satisfying day.</p>

<h4>what.</h4>
<ul><li>This is a journal of our life, culture, libraries, the Apple Macintosh, progressive politics, and of course historic Madison, Indiana, the most beautiful rivertown in America.</li></ul>

<h4>who.</h4> 

<ul><li>G'day, I'm E.G. Yarnetsky and I answer questions at our local library. I'm preparing to go to grad school in January. I'm a former journalist who still dabbles in design work. My wife's a potter who makes beautiful functional and sculptural ceramics.</li></ul>
