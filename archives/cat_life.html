	<h3>Last MovableType entry</h3>
	
	<p>I *finally* finished my second summer session and I'm only waiting to get my grade from my final paper. I think my paper on "blogging for accessibility" turned out pretty decent. I may post it later to get some feedback on it.</p>

<p>The treat I'm giving myself for surviving the summer is to move to a new blogging system. I got tired of my MovableType 2.66. I thought about upgrading to MT 3.1, but then I'd have to pay to do my wife's website on it.</p>

<p>So I am currently working on a move to <a href="http://www.textpattern.com">Textpattern</a> and should make the site live within a couple days. While it takes some getting used to, I'm enjoying the flexibility it's provides. For example, having a sidebar blog is now very easy so I now have a place for short posts like mini-reviews and fun websites.</p>

<p>The program is still under development, they are on a final candidate release and just locked down the features about a week ago. As a result, there are very few templates to work from so I cobbled a few of them together to get what I want. I figure I can be more creative on a future release. </p>

<p>To get a feel for what people are doing with Textpattern, try a visit over to <a href="http://txpmagazine.kbbu.de/">TXP Magazine</a> and take a look at the <a href="http://txpmagazine.kbbu.de/all_sites/">sites collection</a>.</p>

	<h3>May you live in interesting times</h3>
	
	<p>Right now I feel like I was given one of those fortune cookies that read��May you live in interesting times� or some such.</p>

<p>Right now I�m in over my head with homework. In five weeks I�ve written more than 50 pages in papers and I have at least another dozen to go before I can quit next week. I think the last time I wrote that much in a short period of time was for our local paper during the 1997 flood.</p>

<p>Either way, after this class I�ll be a third of the way toward a masters degree.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I have once again shuffled myself into the middle of a historic preservation hullabaloo as a member of the Madison Historic District Board of Review.</p>

<p>A property owner pre-meditatively violated our historic district ordinance after we turned him down for vinyl windows on his 19th century industrial/commercial building. All of the sudden, my name�s been in the paper about every other day and on local online forums.</p>

<p>The board is in a bad position. One one hand we have a very weak ordinance with no design guidelines. On the other our community has a strong libertarian streak where people don�t like to be told what to do with their properties. It amazes me that through all this some people seem to think we enjoy doing what we do.</p>

<p>I�m learning to live with the notion I�ll be a punching bag for people�s views on preservation in Madison. However, I just hope people will continue allowing me to serve them in peace at the library (if that makes sense).</p>

	<h3>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince arrives</h3>
	
	<p>Darlene just got an email that the new Harry Potter book had shipped. "Shoot, I guess that means I won't get it today. Oh, who knows maybe they'll deliver it later. You can always hope."</p>

<p>Well, not 10 minutes later, I hear a light knock on the door. I had to scramble to get downstairs. The mailman was already down the street, but I managed to catch him.</p>

<p>Of course, he hands me a box labeled "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince."</p>

<p>I now have a happy potter reading Harry Potter...</p>

	<h3>Organic groceries in Madison!</h3>
	
	<p>Madison has joined the big leagues of food. A new grocery open here downtown that offers organic food, fruit, vegatables, meats and cheeses. The variety is wonderful.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.localharvestmarket.com">Local Harvest Market</a>. They're planning an "e-market" that will open soon so you can get an idea of what they're carrying.</p>

<p>What amazes me is they even have FRESH fish flown in from the coast three times a week. I don't know the last time I've had fresh fish. Also every kind of meat you can imagine-- we can even get bison, rabbit and duck. If you have the opportunity, you should try organic free-range chicken eggs. They really are pretty amazing.</p>

<p>They also have prepared meals. We had beef curry rice for dinner tonight. They also had grilled swordfish with pineapple and mango sauce. They'll even make you sandwiches from fresh baked bread and premium Boar's Head meats from their deli cut to order. I'm told sushi is also coming soon.</p>

<p>I know one of the people who will be working there and she said they all attended workshops to learn about the products they'll be selling. Indeed, she attended a fullday on just wines and cheeses.</p>

<p>While I doubt I could afford to buy all my food there, but I am very much looking forward to sampling the fare, this will be fun-- real food!</p>

		<h2>06.09.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Yesterday? homework. Today? homework. Tomorrow?</h3>
	
	<p>Well, tomorrow is class, but the day after that will be homework too.</p>

<p>I'm coming up on the end of my first summer session and I'm amazed at how much information is being squeezed into the short space. Having taken two 16-week courses and now one six-week course-- I'd prefer quarters over semesters and summer sessions. I think the class is going pretty well, though I'm behind on the reading (what else is new). </p>

<p>Unfortunately, Mother Nature is not helping me much here. </p>

<p>We managed to get air conditioning in our building for the first time just as it hit 94.8 her downtown this week. However, I'd love to know what tree, mold or mite is doing me in. I'm having an extreme allergic reaction to something. I'm wanting to tear my eyes out and it feels like I'm breathing hot sands into my lungs.</p>

<p>Some prescription eye drops I had left over from last summer's allergy attack helped, but Claritin wasn't doing the trick so I went in to see the doctor today.</p>

<p>He didn't tell me anything I didn't already know-- I'm joining the thousands who are suffering from the Ohio River Valley Crud. ORVC is a catch-all malady that is suffered at vaying times of year by valley residents. It typifies the valley as a cauldron of allergies and sinus junk. </p>

<p>Mind you, I didn't like the prescription-- my insurance charged me $40 for Zyrtec-D and I have to take corticosteroid hormone junk for my lungs starting in the morning. While I really didn't like the side effect from the last time I had to take the stuff, I'll take that over not breathing. It's indeed like the billboard about asthma, it is kind of like being a fish out of water.</p>

		<h2>05.29.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Wanderlust and Memorial Day weekend</h3>
	
	<p>When Darlene and I were in college we wandered just about every road in western Ohio. Once we got out of college, other than vacation, we lost the wanderlust.</p>

<p>But now that I'm driving back and forth to Indy every week I've regained my wanderlust. There's only so many times you can drive down I-65 without getting sick of it. There's just something satisfying about being on the road not yet traveled.</p>

<p>As a result I'm finding about every way to drive from Indy to Madison. So far I'd say my favorite is Indiana 3 between Greensburg and North Vernon. It was a very "springy-Hoosierish" day. Barns sitting out in deep green rolling fields. Just nice.</p>

<p>After class on Friday, we went to visit Darlene's family near Lima, Ohio, for the holiday. We drove up from Indy to Marion and then went straight east through the flat farmlands of eastern Indiana. The fields were huge, going from the road back at least a mile in every direction before you hit a stand of trees. Wheat fields are starting to grow.</p>

<p>We crossed into Ohio going over the Wabash River (yes Hoosiers, it starts in Ohio) and over to Grand Lake St. Mary's. The largest inland lake in Ohio, it was created to be the resevoir for the Miami-Erie Canal. The lake is an impossible blue. I'd only seen photos that blue somewhere in the Caribbean. The lake is flanked by Celina and St. Mary's, Both are nice towns. Celina is the resort town of the two with nice homes and condos line the lake. St. Mary's was the canal town with fragments of the Miami-Erie still flowing through town.</p>

<p>It's great to wander. It helps cures the urge to runaway from home when I need to be studying.</p>

<p>The weekend has been fun. I have managed to get a chunk of reading for class done, but we've also done a good share of partying with her family.</p>

<p>We went to a "school's out for summer" party at Darlene's sister's house and helped watch about 40 kids party. Two of her sister's kids are in a hard rock garage band and heard them play last night. Of course, they were indeed playing in the garage. They were really good considering the oldest was only 15.</p>

<p>Today about half the family came out to her parents' house. Two of my brothers-in-law and I played a couple hours of frisbee golf. Here's a typical hole for us... We'd start from the bed of Stan's pickup truck, throw down across the back field into a dried pond, back across the barley field and into the compost bin, back up the field and into the corn wagon bin finally tosing the frisbee through the front window of the pickup to complete the hole. I had a 15 on that hole. We didn't play a par anything the whole game.</p>

<p>Toss in a really moist turkey and two pretty decent car races and it's a been a pretty good Memorial Day weekend. Mind you I have another chunk of homework before we'll head home tomorrow.</p>

	<blockquote>Did I tell you about the scare I had over my cat recently? She'd gotten out and I thought she'd gotten pregnant, but as it turns out, she had merely eaten a whole ball of yarn. And then she had mittens.</blockquote>

	<h3>Spring fever</h3>
	
	<p>It's a beautiful day in good old Madison, Indiana. You can look down the streets and see pink and white blossoms and verdant new leaves poking out of the branches.</p>

<p>I'm doing homework and Darlene mudding the drywall in her new kiln room. She also received her new Peter Pugger de-airing pugmill which mixes, recycles and prepares clay. In go scraps (wet or dry) and out comes fresh, ready to use clay. Amazing.</p>

<p>Three more weeks and the semester is over and I'll have six grad credits under my belt-- 16% towards an MLS.</p>

<p>At the library we're getting ready for our National Library Week events. The top event is probably a professional poetry reading. The local poet has created a new program that will be premiering in New York City next month. We're also going to make our wireless network available to the public as well.</p>

<p>That's life, the universe and everything. May your spring day be as pretty as ours.<br />

		<h2>03.22.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Vacation all I ever wanted...</h3>
	
	<p>Just finished our five day mini-vacation. Three days of homework and two days of partying. It was a good combo.</p>

<p>Darlene and I celebrated our 15th wedding anniversary down in Louisville, Ky., the romance capital of the world for the weekend of March 19-20, 2005. I honestly don't know if that's true or not, but we certainly had fun.</p>

<p>We spent the night in a suite, took in an art exhibit, slept, slept, slept. Had really, really good fried green tomatoes, fried catfish and crab cakes (Goose Creek Diner on Goose Creek Road), did a little shopping and swam in a small hotel pool inhabited by a kick of soccer players.</p>

<p>Sunday afternoon was glorious. The first really spring-like day that we got to enjoy. We soaked up the sun on Louisville's riverfront. Walking around, playing frisee and watching in-line skaters do crazy stunts on stairs while a friend recorded it all on videotape (he was trying to create a video for his portfolio with hopes of getting into the Savannah College of Art and Design).</p>

<p>After all that getting back into the swing of studying again has been a bear. I'm not succeeding to be honest.</p>

<p>I have an open book midterm exam in my afternoon class on Friday and  I thought I'd be OK until I realized I'm going to the Indiana Library Federation annual conference on Thursday....hmmmm..... I'll just have everyone else drive and I'll read through my notes. As long as I have a general outline in my mind and have everything I need at my fingertips, I should be OK. But still, I'm pushing my luck.</p>

<p>What else is new?</p>

		<h2>03.15.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Life, the universe and everything</h3>
	
	<p>"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" the movie is supposed to come out in the next month or so. I saw a preview and it looks like it'll be fun, but already I have one major, major problem with it. Ford Prefect does not have an English accent. Oh well...</p>

<p>I'm trying to get going on my major cataloging project-- full MARC records on 10 volumes of the prof's choosing. I'm getting there. I'm taking a few days off to work on the homework and to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary coming up on Sunday.</p>

<p>We got a fright from our electric company. We finally have our annex separated off on it its own meter and wiring so we had the electric company turn off the meter so the renter can put it in his own name. Well.... they turned off the electric to the building next door and it took them a day to figure out why. </p>

<p>Apparently we have always been paying their electricity bill and they have been paying ours. The kicker... they now want us to pay the difference for the past year... to the figure of.... hold onto your chairs.... $1,295.</p>

<p>It's not our fault by any stretch. Apparently, the mix up came when the attorneys who owned our building split off the electric. They mixed up the meters at some point then and it wasn't discovered until we worked on ours.</p>

<p>I was feeling guilty for not having Darlene's website updated in an eon, but was having a hard time getting my web design program working for some reason. So I chucked it all and redesigned it from scratch. Though I cheated a little bit. I used the same template I had designed for this blog and adjusted it a little for her website. So they're twins for a little while, but in the future it'll get more of it's own flavor. Check out <a hre="http://www.mudcatpottery.com">Mudcat Pottery</a>.</p>

<p>Today is the day I get my annual performance review. I hate those things, but I'll suck it up and be a good camper. Tomorrow I start my mini-homework vacation and won't have to think about work for a few days.</p>

	<h3>Revenge of the gummie bears</h3>
	
	<p>I'd have to say my favorite treat is chocolate-covered gummie bears from Sweden.  I'm not a huge gummie fan, but there's something about the tangy semi-dark chocolate combined with the soft-fruity gummie bears that does the trick.</p>

<p>I'll get a $1 or $2 worth on special occasions at Mundt's, a local candy store famous for it's fish candy. Darlene bought me some for my birthday.</p>

<p>Well I finally ate a few of them tonight while doing my homework and I am now suffering from a pretty bad chocolate buzz-headache. ooofff.... but boy they were good.</p>

	<h3>Entry #321: It's a Happy Birthday</h3>
	
	<p>Well, in two years, I could wear a black arm band and mourn. I'm taking the day off from everything, just kicking around the house with my Darlin'.</p>

<p>Darlene bought me a gift certificate to the Apple iTunes store. She was amazed you can find them at our downtown grocery store. I got myself a bunch of 80s music-- the Go-Gos (yes, they did do some cool tunes), Marshall Crenshaw, Psychadelic Furs, Split Enz, Supertramp and for the fun of it Petula Clark's "Downtown." Slowly but surely I'm collecting all the music I listened to in high school and college.  I need to listen to the radio more often so I can here some new music. I just never have the opportunity. I could probably listen to WTTS out of Bloomington on the way to Indy, but I'm now stuck in podcats.</p>

<p>My email inbox was full of birthday cards. They were all great, but I think my favorite was set in outer space with the Star Wars theme playing in the background with words moving across the screen.... "Forget about the past, you can't change it..... forget about the future, you can't predict it..... forget about the present, I didn't get you one."  I was rolling on bed laughing.</p>

<p>My mom, meanwhile, was sneaky. She brought my present down when she visited for New Year's and Darlene hid it for her ever since. It's a gorgeous book... "The Most Beautiful Libraries in the World." The Italian libraries, such as the Vatican Library, seem to be more about the structure and the frescos than the books, but the French and British libraries are beautiful...you just want to sit in them and study for hours on end. I loved the New York Public Library photos and the Library of Congress reading room is amazing (though I was disappointed that they didn't show the stacks, boring in comparison?)</p>

<p>We're finishing the evening by watching Hayao Miyazaki's "Castle in the Sky." We'll probably have to finish it tomorrow, but boy his work is awesome. <a href="http://disney.go.com/disneyvideos/animatedfilms/miyazaki/index2.html">Check it out</a> if you can.<br />

		<h2>02.06.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>No time this time, no time at all</h3>
	
	<p>Admittedly it's only been a month in grad school, but so far I'm enjoying the homework, reading, etc. It feels good to do something constructive. Getting my brain to think is a good thing (as Martha would say...)<br />
 <br />
Yet, I'm already finding I have to deprive myself of a few luxuries. For example, when I see one of my favorite mysteries show up in the new books shelf... I can't read it. I need to do homework.</p>

<p>When I see something that drives me crazy, I don't have time to go tracking down all the links so no one thinks I'm making these crazy things up. For example, there's a bill being introduced that could give the secretary of homeland security the ability to bypass any law on the books with no review. </p>

<p>For those needing their fix on progressive politics, I'll try to add some more good political links. Outside of those links I suspect my political rants will be linkless.</p>

<p>Heck, I bought the new Adobe Creative Suite software and haven't even touched it yet. Darlene wanted to know what I wanted for my birthday and my first thought was Apple's new iWork, but who has time for it? Now you know it's desperate times.</p>

<p>Well, I'd better get used to it. I still have 23 more months to go.</p>

		<h2>01.27.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Back from the dead</h3>
	
	<p>It was a stupid mistake.</p>

<p>Darlene and I received new debit cards recently. They had the same numbers so I didn't think anything of it. Until a few days ago when we were locked out of our webserver, our email, my blog-- all suddenly nonexistent.</p>

<p>It turns out I forgot to update the expiration date. They cut me off for a bill of $5.88.</p>

<p>Obviously, that's been corrected.</p>

<p>Meanwhile life is suddenly becoming a soap opera.</p>

<p>--One of our friends is undergoing a sudden and potentially messy divorce. He's also the person who's doing work on our building. He's over here working on our electric just to keep busy in days his other projects are being rained out. </p>

<p>--Another set of friends had some unexpected health problems. Another friends' brother has heart problems</p>

<p>--I got misquoted in the newspaper's coverage of our last historic district board of review meeting (though not really the reporter's fault). Between being misquoted and coverage of what other members said during the meeting, I suddenly feel like I have a target on my back in town. There's an "open forum" website in town, which has the high goal of free speech. That's fine, but it also enables people to slam you anonymously. Of course, I got slammed good. Unfortunately, I don't have a thick enough skin yet. I guess that's politics for you. I'm probably going to have to write a letter to the editor.</p>

<p>--There's other stuff going on, but publishing it here could put even a bigger target on my back. </p>

<p>As such, it's hard to concentrate. Going to class tomorrow will actually be a nice break.</p>

	<h3>Snippets for Jan. 5, 2005</h3>
	
	<p>We partied like crazy over the New Year's holiday. My mom visited from Buffalo for a few days. We visited with friends, ate midnight dinner to end out 2004 and visited more friends on New Years Day. We've played with kids and played games like crazy folk.</p>

<p><br />
We had warm temperatures all last week that quickly melted our snow and it has rained ever since. We're expecting a "bankful" in the Ohio River here at Madison. Creeks in the region are flooding. While we're getting a ton of rain, Darlene's sister in Blufton, Ohio, is getting an ice storm. Branches breaking everywhere.</p>

	<h3>Couldn't resist</h3>
	
	<p>The call of family is rather strong at Christmas and we couldn't resist. We traveled to see Darlene's family in Ohio afterall. The roads in Indiana were passable, but the average speed was about 40 mph. The interstates in Ohio were actually pretty decent considering. I guess the winds were not as strong as the weathermen initially anticipated so the drifting stayed to a minimum.</p>

<p>We were settled in for the weekend when we talked with Darlene's father. The roads got cleared a lot faster than anyone thought so we made a last minute decision to come.</p>

<p>If everyone skipped Christmas we could have dealt with the disappointment, but with everyone being here, we couldn't skip it. Fortunately, by tonight everything was in pretty good shape.</p>

<p>Thank you Lord, let's celebrate Christmas!</p>

		<h2>12.22.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Snow and the 21st century</h3>
	
	<p>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas. A stack of gifts for family inside and a thickening bed of snow outside. </p>

<p>Also, the Christmas shoppers finally decended on us last Saturday and that put us at ease. We sold enough pots to keep our bills up to date this winter. It's rather odd to hope people will spend lots of money when we know its tough out there.  Nonetheless, this will probably be the first winter in our married lives that we can take out Chinese once a week and not feel guilty. Out of curiousity, Darlene talked with other merchants in downtown Madison and they're having the same luck-- it's pretty slow this year.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we are indeed getting our first "snow" of the winter. We had some flurries a week ago, but nothing stuck so it doesn't count. Our latest forecast called for four inches today and three more tonight (at one point they called for 10 inches--darn). </p>

<p>We're driving north for a quick Christmas and Darlene's family in the Lima, Ohio, area is expecting anything from 9 to 16 inches. Darlene's sister (one of four) loves the snow, so Darlene emailed her "don't get carried away" with prayers for white stuff so we can actually get into town. We have memories along those lines. </p>

<p>Several years ago we traveled up to her parents for Christmas and our station wagon broke down on the highway. It was 2 a.m. and it was barely above 0 degrees. We lucked out royally as the only deputy on duty in the whole county happened upon us and we got rescued by her father.</p>

<p>Well, this year it is again supposed to be frigid (in addition to the snow) so we did the unthinkable... we bought a cellphone. We were planning on getting one for my weekly commute to Indianapolis for grad school, but I wasn't planning on buying the thing until next year (OK, two weeks from now).</p>

<p>The experience was painful. I got a salesman at Radio Shack who was obviously trying to keep going as they had a long day. He kept saying things that weren't true and added some pressure sales to boot. I hate that because it makes it hard to determine whether the person is telling you the "truth" in order to make good decisions or if he has bills to pay and is trying to pad his commission. In the end I ended up spending about $80 more than I thought as I bought a car charger and a warrenty.</p>

<p>Part of the reason it was expensive is I decided to go with the "Pay As You Go" plan. If I don't use it much I only have to pay $15/mo. to keep the phone number instead of $30-$50 a month under a contract.</p>

<p>*Sigh* Some things about 21st century technology I love, like my Powerbook and wireless Internet, but I'm just not sure about cell phones.</p>

<p>So I could figure out how to use the damn thing, I took the phone with me to the grocery down the block and called Darlene. At least down here, the quality is a lot better than I expected. We've gotten cell calls that were really spotty and this one was crystal clear. After a few minutes I broke off the call to check out.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Darlene called me. It was stereotypical. I jumped with my eyes wide open as the phone vibrated in my pocket. It would have been funny if Darlene had said something to the effect of "Hi Darlin' is that a cell phone in your pocket or are you just glad to see me."</p>

		<h2>11.23.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>More vacation snippets</h3>
	
	<p>We got back from vacation late on Saturday night. Boy it went too quick. We had a lot of fun though. Now we're busting our butts getting ready for Darlene's <a href="http://www.mudcatpottery.com">holiday open house</a>.</p>

<p><b>Niagara Falls</b></p>

<p>While we spent most of the week with my mom, we visited Niagara Falls for an evening and a morning. </p>

<p>Our first stop was on Goat Island, the island that is between the American and Horseshoe Falls (sometimes called the "Canadian Falls" even though half of it is in the United States).</p>

<p>We saw these weird white boxes everywhere and had to ask a ranger. They cover the stalks of lamp posts to protect them during the winter. Why? Well, the ranger said ice from the mist builds up all winter to a height of two dozen feet. "See those snow fenses? Those will soon be covered in ice and we'll put two more layers on top of that before the winter is done." No wonder the trees on the edge of the island are knarly.</p>

<p>The ranger told us he was amazed at how people left their common sense at home when they visited. People regularly climb safety fenses for a better view or wade into the rapids. The rapids don't look bad in places, but one slip and you are over the falls in 20 seconds. He even stopped a mom who was wading with her baby in the water off the Three Sister Islands. It's even worse when he has to communicate danger to someone who doesn't understand English.</p>

<p>We stayed at a hotel near the international bridge. We got a good deal on a room complete with a jacuzzi, a king bed, a fake fireplace, odd wallpaper and way too many mirrors for our tastes. But hey it was fun. </p>

<p>We walked all over the place that night. The falls are illuminated at night with huge colored beams from the Canadian side. The light show was nice, but watching mist from the Horseshoe Falls swirl and dance reflecting the colored lights was downright cool. </p>

<p>Literally and figuratively. If you've never been to the falls, there is a zone where it rains 24-7. In the summer it's blessedly cool, but in the fall and winter it is downright freezing. Thus we truly enjoyed the jacuzzi when we walked back to the hotel.</p>

<p><b>Buffalo-Erie County Public Library</b></p>

<p>We visited the Buffalo-Erie County Public Library and I had a rather interesting experience. </p>

<p>First strike. I walked into the downtown branch and saw a kiosk design I liked so I went to take a picture to share the idea with my director. Instantly the security guards pounced and ordered me not to take the photo. When I explained why I wanted the photo and asked why I couldn't take it, they escorted me clear across the library to the administrative offices. Apparently they had a slew of places they didn't want photos taken so they just made a blanket "no photos without permission" policy. Unfortunately, it's not posted anywhere and having a security guard sic you isn't the best way of implementing the policy. Whatever.</p>

<p>Second strike. I had to email an ad to our local paper. I called ahead to see if the library had CD drives so I wouldn't have to drag my laptop to a downtown wi-fi hotspot. The person on the phone said sure, no problem. I get down there with CD in hand and they did not have CD drives. Bad information. grrrrrrrrrrrr. Maybe the good Lord was trying to give me one of those "this is why you need to double-check your information before telling patrons" kind of lessons.</p>

<p>Third strike. Mark Twain lived in Buffalo for about 18 months. He was part owner of a daily paper there and had just married. They left after tragedy struck her family and moved to Elmira, NY. Either way, Buffalo is proud of its Twain year and the library was given the ORIGINAL manuscript of Huck Finn. I saw several pages of the manuscript. It's wonderful to see the effort of handwriting. As a result, the library gift shop has a lot of Twain memorabilia. Unfortunately, because I got dragged to the admin offices and talked with the tech guy to see if he could help me (he couldn't) I missed seeing the gift shop. It closed three minutes before we got there.</p>

<p>The central branch is undergoing a major renovation and I look forward to seeing the results. Unfortunately, the libraries are in danger of closing as Medicaid is eating the county's budget alive. The county executive has threatened to close everything (libraries, zoo, etc.) if he doesn't get a hike in sales tax to 9.25%. We'll see what happens over the next two weeks.</p>

<p><b>Frank Lloyd Wright</b></p>

<p>Another favorite stop was touring the "opus" of Frank Lloyd Wright's Prarie-style homes-- the <a href="http://www.darwinmartinhouse.org/">Darwin Martin House</a>. </p>

<p>It was built in 1903-1905 for Martin who was a top executive with the huge Larkin Soap Company. Unfortunately, during the depression he lost a boat load of money (like everyone else) and died deeply in debt. As a result his wife had to abandon the property. It was then vacant for nearly 15 years when a local architect bought it and saved it from destruction. Now, umpteen years later, they are working on giving it a proper restoration.</p>

<p>Wright's attention to detail was astounding, he literally designed to control the house's occupants. Through the design, he controlled where you walked, where you stopped, where you looked and, because he even designed almost all the furniture, how you lived. Amazing.</p>

<p>The 90-minute tour was well worth the $10 ticket. I'll visit it again in a couple years to see the progress. </p>

<p>Wright did a lot of work in Buffalo, in large part due to Darwin Martin. Wright did a crack job for Martin because he knew his company was wanting a new corporate headquarters. He indeed got the contract and the resulting <a href="http://www.pbs.org/flw/buildings/larkin/larkin.html">Larkin Building</a> was not only his first major project, but also rather innovative. Unfortunately, when Larkin closed they could not come up with another use for the structure and it was demolished in 1950.</p>

<p>Other structures were planned, but not built. The city is now working on completing several of his unfinished projects. One of them just finished is the "Blue Sky Mausoleum" which at first seems odd, but slowly strikes one as very peaceful. It grows on you. Here's an <a href="http://archrecord.construction.com/news/daily/archives/041122wright.asp">article</a> on the project from Architectural Record.</p>

	<h3>Vacation snippets</h3>
	
	<p>Boy is it good to be on vacation in a blue state (hardly any Bush stickers to look at).</p>

<p>We visited Niagara-on-the-Lake today, a wonderful Victorian resort sorta town with a ton of wineries (didn't go to any) and lots of theatre (didn't see any) and lots of shops (we definitely did the shops). I bought a really cool <a href="http://www.hannahats.com">Irish-style hat</a>, Darlene bought a bowl and platter from Lakeshore Pottery and we started our Christmas shopping for Darlene's family.</p>

<p>There are a ton of squirells who are a little too used to human beings. Darlene was about to offer a black squirrel a piece of a scone when the squirrel ran up her leg and literally ripped the food from her fingers clawing into her thumb in the process. We were STUNNED to say the least. Darlene reports that it was one hell of a strong squirrel that did not want to let go of her finger.</p>

<p>We've also taken in some good art at the Burchfield-Penny Art Center, some good shopping at one of the greatest grocery chains we've ever been to (Wegmans, which is out of Rochester, NY) and rewatched one of the best animated films ever made, The Iron Giant.</p>

<p>Photos, including the black attack squirrel will be posted when we get home.</p>

	<h3>Just read the First Amendment</h3>
	
	<p>I just had an interesting experience, I actually read the First Amendment of the <a title="LII: Constitution" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html">Bill of Rights</a> for the first time in a long time.</p>

<p>There is a word in the first phrase that is often included that is not really there.</p>

<blockquote>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. </blockquote>

<p>It's interesting how a single word, indeed a single letter, can influence how people think about the amendment.</p>

	<h3>Blog entry No. 249</h3>
	
	<p>OK, I'm a bit fried right now. We are now the proud owners of a black egg. Hmmm, maybe it's a licorice jelly bean. Either way, you call it as you see it, but it's by name a 1995 Toyota Previa DX S/C.</p>

<p><img alt="95prevcar.gif" src="http://www.ontheriversedge.com/images/95prevcar.gif" width="400" height="222" border="0" /></p>

<p>We were expecting a very long search for something reliable when this puppy just showed up in the local paper and its previous owners are regulars at the library. </p>

<p>Darlene is absolutely in love with it. The visibility from the drivers seat is literally panoramic, it handles like a dream and runs like a top.. </p>

<p>I, on the other hand, am so-so on it. The seat has sunken a bit so the back support is a little too high. I need to find a way to sit properly in the thing. Maybe a cushion. It's also not built for someone who's six-foot. I don't quite have the leg room I'm used to.</p>

<p>At the very least Darlene has a vehicle she'll love and I hope I can get used to it.<br />
___________<br />
I had just written a whole bunch more stuff, but I accidentally lost it when I hit the wrong key combination. I'm using Windows so often at work that keep hitting the wrong keys. I was reaching for "control" instead of the "command." Oh well, maybe I'll write it better the second time around.</p>

		<h2>10.10.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Now doing the floor</h3>
	
	<p>Improvements are once again starting to occur at the Mudcat Building.</p>

<p>About two years ago we replaced the roof on our building's warehouse annex. It should have been replaced 20 years ago. Water was pouring through it so bad, it might as well been without a roof entirely.</p>

<p>The flooring was similarly shot by having water pour down. Now, two years later, we're attacking the floor.</p>

<p>Yesterday we took out the extraneous layers of OSB fiberboard in order to get down to the original flooring. We hoped the bottom layer would be in good enough shape to simply build on top of it. However, it too was pretty well shot so then we pulled up all the boards on half the floor. This exposed the beams, a couple of which are covered with mushrooms. We'll replace those too *sigh*</p>

<p>We had to drag all that wood out of the warehouse and then get it cut up so our friend could use it as firewood this winter. This was an exhausting process, but it beats having to pay for a dumpster.</p>

<p>I managed to work eight hours without hurting myself (which I rarely do anymore, but I still live with the alleged reputation of getting hurt in weird ways). I'm rather sore this morning, but what should I expect?</p>

<p>We'll post photos as soon as I manage to get them out of the camera. It's a rather impressive looking space. In New York City, the loft alone would go for a cool million easily. Mind you this is Madison.</p>

<p>This is a keystone project for us. Finishing this will allow us to upgrade the electric and expand Darlene's studio. Very good things as a specific recently imprisoned person might say.</p>

		<h2>10.01.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Finally... a day off</h3>
	
	<p>It seems like it's been weeks since we've had a day off. </p>

<p>I worked a week, studied while Darlene got ready for Chautauqua, I worked a week, I took the GRE, Darlene got ready for Chautauqua, I worked a week and then we spend the weekend in the sun doing the Chautauqua, then I worked a week.</p>

<p>Thank the good Lord that tomorrow is a day off!</p>

<p>Mind you, it'll be running errands and opening the studio. I'm doing all the catch up stuff that I've missed because of the GRE and Chautauqua. For example, I have three websites to update and I promised a new one for a consulting firm my friend works at.</p>

<p>Oh well, could be worse. I could still have to study for the GRE. (I'm still waiting for my essay scores....grrrrr).</p>

<p><br />
Meanwhile, Chautauqua went fine. Comparing Chautauqua sales this year to last year, we were down $400. Yet, for the first time ever, we had sales the week leading up to Chautauqua-- good sales. It seems a number of people were rushing to buy stuff before it found its way down to the show-- a local's sneak preview sale if you will. I won't argue. Combine that in and we are doing a lot better than last year. </p>

		<h2>09.30.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Yes, we're still alive...</h3>
	
	<p>Though for a minute I wondered if Darlene was.</p>

<p>I'm sitting here doing my evening surf and Darlene's in her glaze room working on a load. A typical evening in the Mudcat Building.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I hear yell "Shiiiittt" and then nothing. She generally only swears when it truly warrents it, that got my attention, but when I didn't hear anything I started worrying.</p>

<p>"Hon? What's up?" Nothing. "Hon?" With a little more urgency.</p>

<p>I can't remember exactly what she said, but I remember the sight.</p>

<p>She was standing there a bit wet with the sink faucet in her hand. </p>

<p>The pressure of the water had blown the faucet off the sink. We knew it was old and cheap, but she didn't expect that. </p>

<p>Thus, I understand the silence-- pure shock.</p>

<p>I tried to reset the faucet, but it didn't hold and she got wet again. Oh well. We'll buy a new one. I can't imagine how old the other one was anyhow.</p>

		<h2>09.17.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Thank God that's over with</h3>
	
	<p>Well, I did it and I survived. I took the GRE this afternoon and did well enough that I'm not embarrassed to report my scores to the Indiana University School of Library and Information Science.</p>

<p>I didn't do as well on my verbal as I had on a couple of my practice tests, but based on estimates (I'll know exact percentiles in a few weeks) I still managed to get into the top 15%.</p>

<p>The quantitative I'm happy with. I beat my practice scores and even beat the national average by 30 points. Considering my math skills had deteriorated significantly prior to studying, I'm satisfied.</p>

<p>I believe I did well on the analytic writing essays as well, but I won't learn those scores for a few weeks either.</p>

<p>I'm also happy with my scores considering I woke up at 3 a.m. and couldn't get back to sleep for Lord knows how long. (Our alarm clock was on the blitz because some guy broke in to the transformer station and <a href="http://www.madisoncourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=4&SubSectionID=253&ArticleID=20097">turned off the power to downtown</a> last night...bizarre story). Then we got off to Louisville a later than I wanted and I had to skip lunch. Fortunately, Darlene had the foresight to bring a bottle of water, a banana and a snack bag of Cheezits for me to munch on. It was just enough to get me through.</p>

<p>I sat down at the computer and, after a few minutes of mild panic, the rest of the test went fine. I'm amazed at how focused I was able to get when it counted. Mind you when I was done, the adrenaline rush came to a crash and I was nearly shaking.</p>

<p>While I was taking the test, Darlene enjoyed some shopping for the first time in an eon and bought me a very classy forest green sweater as a "congratulations for surviving" gift. We kicked back Louisville for a little bit, had seafood for dinner and walked around a bookstore and health food store (I got hooked on almond butter and that's the only place I can find it). After all that I finally was able to wind down a bit.</p>

<p>But I did it, I'm done and I'm ready to crash for the night.</p>

		<h2>09.14.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>The answer is 42</h3>
	
	<p>Snippets from life, the universe and everything...</p>

<p>I went with our assistant director to a couple of festivals on Saturday to talk up the library. In the afternoon we watched the longest continuous Pony Express Run in the nation run at the Canaan Fall Festival. We then spent the evening listening to a mariachi band at Fiesta Latina. [<b>update</b>: <a href="http://cards.webshots.com/cp-85868742-GChc-album/186867416ASTayc">festival photos</a>)</p>

<p>It was good to get out of the library because it's been hot as hell in there the last few days. Our contractor cut off our air conditioning to install new units and it was easily in the upper-80s in the library. I worked in it Sunday afternoon and if it wasn't for the fans we would have just died. Fortunately, they hooked it back up this afternoon so I am hoping tomorrow will be better.</p>

<p>Also, after a summer worth of probably unneccessary wrangling with computer consultants, I've chosen someone to do the wireless internet project at the library. I'm enjoying high-speed wireless at home and it'll be great to have it at the library for anyone to use. </p>

<p>Mind you, after last week, I think anyone would agree that our library is a "hot spot."</p>

<p>Darlene's got pots everywhere in her studio and is trying to get them through the kiln in time for the <a href="http://www.madisonchautauqua.com/">Madison Chautauqua</a>. She figures she'll get seven more glaze loads through which is pretty good. </p>

<p>We had a scare as her kiln couldn't make it to 2200F and shut itself down. Turns out the lid is getting a little warped and we're losing too much heat out the top. She put a brick on the lid to hold the seal and that was enough to do the trick. This evening she pulled out a very nice load of pots. Very rich glazes came out o f the kiln. Some new kiln bricks on top should do the trick.</p>

<p>Sunday morning, I felt my first earthquake ever. This one was 95 miles away, but I was just the right place to feel it-- on our third floor bathroom toilet (sigh... what timing). If I hadn't been on such a solid surface high up in an antique brick building I doubt I would have noticed. I wasn't able to confirm my assumed hallucination until that evening when I checked the <a href="http://pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/shake/STORE/Xnhad_04/ciim_display.html">earthquake</a> center website to see a 3.6 hit near Shelbyville, Indiana.</p>

<p>Studying for the GRE is oddly a nice diversion from politics. My math is improving and I think I'll be able to hit my goal of a 600 on the section (I need a minimum of 500). I'm learning that getting problems right in practice and right in a testing situation are two different things. In an untimed practice I got 52/60 questions right. On a timed test this evening I got 18/28. (To compare the two fractions, multiply the denominators and cross multiply for the numerators). I just need to make sure I write it all down. It's very easy to miss details when you're trying to rush it. Quick which is greater? The arithmatic mean of 7, 3, 5, 1 or the mean of 2a-5, 4a, 7-6a?</p>

<p>I'll find out on Friday if I've picked up enough speed and remembered all the formulas. Fortunately, I have Thursday off for last minute studying. By the way, the two are equal.</p>

	<h3>Friday, Sept. 17, at 1 p.m.</h3>
	
	<p>Prayers are welcome. That is when I take my GRE. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, my application for grad school at Indiana U. (library and information science) is just about complete. I need to do one last write-through on my statement of purpose and figure out how I'm supposed to get transcripts to them. I also need to fill out my financial aid forms so I can get some loans for this venture.</p>

		<h2>08.06.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>A wonderful week</h3>
	
	<p>Our building was once a hotel in the 1870s-80s. For three days it seemed to be a hotel again as Darlene's sister and 7 of her 8 kids came to visit for three days.</p>

<p>It was a blast. They all had a turn on Darlene's pottery wheel. We took them to see Harry Potter at our 1930s movie theatre here in town. Spent a day swimming at our WPA pool.</p>

<p>Yesterday we took them to the Louisville Zoo. Their new butterfly exhibit is pretty impressive. I love the blue morphos. <a href="http://www.louisvillezoo.com/news/events/butterflies.htm">"Thousands of flights daily"</a> through Sept. 30.</p>

<p>Finally we took them canoeing at a nearby lake today before they headed home. </p>

<p>Two of gang accidentally tipped their canoe. They both shifted the same direction at the same time. ooops.</p>

<p>Seeing them go over I entered "protective uncle" mode and went to the rescue. Actually, I amazed myself by remembering how to right a flooded canoe in deep water from a single canoe. I read about it years ago and had never done it before, but it worked. </p>

<p>They were laughing and having fun. In a way I wish I had let them enjoy it a little more. Instead I ordered them around a bit so I could get them out of the water and save the canoe.</p>

<p>Everyone seemed to have a fun vacation either way. It was great to see them. They're growing so fast. </p>

<p>Finally, I got a new wireless router. Boy the thing was a royal pain to set up. It's why I hate PCs. Apple routers are simple in comparison, but they're between models for another few weeks so I bought a cheapy to hold me over. In the end I gave up and called tech support. But at least I'm up and running again.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> Thinking back over the mini-vacation with the kids, one of my favorite times was during the credits of "Harry Potter." </p>

<p>Our friend was the manager that night and she told us we could go up on stage and play in the light. So I went up with all the kids and we all shadow boxed, danced and generally made fools of ourselves. Never in my life has that opportunity presented itself and boy did we take advantage of it.</p>

	<h3>Now no wireless... sigh</h3>
	
	<p>After a few days of high speed bliss, my wireless station got fried during a storm we had here Friday night.</p>

<p>Apparently, the first generation of Apple's Airport base station has a problem with weak capacitors. So now I'm looking for a new wireless router. Unfortunately, the one I want has a two week wait....</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we're cleaning our building like crazy as we're expecting Darlene's sister Carol and 7 of her 8 kids. Mudcat Building population will go up 5 fold for four days.</p>

<p>I've been enjoying Internet radio. My favorite find so far is Virgin Radio. Good stuff and very British.</p>

<p>That storm was weird with 40mph winds coming in from the south. For the first time since we owned the building we had rain coming in our open windows on the south side. Result? Our kitchen and bathroom were totally flooded. Fun? Wow...</p>

	<h3>Living life without a Net</h3>
	
	<p>So this is what it feels like to be without Internet. </p>

<p>We ordered Adelphia High Speed Internet and expected to be connected on Tuesday. At first the cable guy couldn't figure out how to pull it off. </p>

<p>Finally, figured out they had to pull a line from across the street, on top of our warehouse addition and between the walls and down into our basement and finally back up to somewhere on our first floor. </p>

<p>So they said they'd be back with three guys and try it again. When? WHO KNOWS!</p>

<p>Yet, we made the mistake of discontinuing our old provider in order to avoid a $22 charge on our bank account for the month. It saved us money, but now we are living life without a net.</p>

<p>When I'll get to blog again I have not idea. </p>

<p>Live life well and don't do anything I wouldn't do.</p>

	<h3>Sometimes it's hard being a geek...</h3>
	
	<p>Every day, I look through <a href="http://www.macsurfer.com">MacSurfer</a> and gather all the news that's fit to Mac. I'd have bought Apple stock at $8 a share if I had the money (boy do I wish). I own an iBook laptop and enjoys surfing in bed by Wi-Fi. Thus I might as well face it that I'm an <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> geek.</p>

<p>Being an Apple geek is easy. Steve Jobs comes out with fun products that work and you get to make fun of Microsoft too. (Though I'll give Bill Gates tons of credit for giving computers to <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Libraries/">libraries</a>). </p>

<p>No one harasses me for being an Apple geek. Indeed, people are sending people my way at the library to answer Mac questions. Being a geek can be fun.</p>

<p>Yet, as if it wasn't obvious, I'm also among the 28 percent of Americans who are "closely following the election." The extent to which would definitely classifies me as a political geek. For example, I don't follow the national polls. I follow the state polls-- the ones that really matter. Check out <a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com">electoral-vote.com</a>.</p>

<p>But being a political geek in a small town is hard sometimes. </p>

<p>On one hand, I'd love to go campaigning door-to-door for candidates who'll make a difference. I did this once for a city council candidate in Toledo. You really feel like you make connections even if you lose (my candidate won state rep. the following year).</p>

<p>On the other hand, I don't want my politics to interfer with my work or my wife's pottery either. </p>

<p>I want everyone to feel comfortable they can come to me for help finding information. On the flip side, I don't want to be harassed in the library for my views either.</p>

<p>Darlene and I already had a guy from Pennsylvania come into our pottery studio and literally bait us into a political argument.</p>

<p>By speaking out in public (or even putting a Kerry sign in my bedroom window), I fear I'd get more of the same or that my job would be compromised. Sometimes I feel even writing in this blog may cost me somehow in the future.</p>

<p>Yet, sometimes I feel like the call to speak out (and not just blog) overwhelming.</p>

<p>Let me give an example. There's an article in this week's <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5411741/site/newsweek">Newsweek</a> about how the Department of Homeland Security is seriously looking at getting the power from Congress to postpone the elections in case of a terrorist attack.</p>

<p>On the face of it, I find this scary. For the past year, my father-in-law kept saying Bush was going to try cancelling the election. But until he sent me a copy of the article, I just didn't think anyone could think of altering such an integral part of our democracy. Now I'm not so sure. This <b>is</b> the same administration that's pushing the Pakistani government to <a href="http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&sid=aiQyYlkml67U&refer=us">capture or kill top Al-Queda</a> operatives during the first three days of the Democratic National Convention.</p>

<p>I'll withhold judgement until I see the legislation, but I swear if I feel Bush is trying to corrupt the system, I'll be protesting loud and long. At that point I won't care about my reputation.</p>

		<h2>07.08.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>vacation musings</h3>
	
	<p>It was nice to play tourist for once. We took a trip to Louisville on business actually and went around after we dropped off some pottery for jurying.</p>

<p>Highlights I'd recommend: Gallopaloosa's artistic horse sculptures is a lot of fun. Lexington, Ky., did horses a few years ago, but Louisville's are on the whole better.</p>

<p>Great exhibit at the Kentucky Museum of Art and Design. Two galleries full of pottery. Our favorite was "Splendid Table" pots for food. Lots of pots we'd love to own. "Tea for Two" is of tea sets, but it failed to fulfill the promise of tea sets that would be used in intimate settings between two spouses, friends or lovers. The work just didn't capture the theme.</p>

<p>Wild Oats is a fun natural food store on Shelbyville Road. We finally got to GlassWorks, but it was too late for the tour. At least they didn't charge us to watch the hot glass demonstrations.</p>

<p>Louisville's art scene is hopping. For a gallery guide check out <a href="http://www.looklouisvilleart.com">LOOK</a></p>

<p>I'll add links later. Notes on Cincinnati coming as well.</p>

	<h3>This is a vacation</h3>
	
	<p>It's hard to believe I'm halfway into my vacation already. But I finally feel like I'm off work.</p>

<p>We did the show in South Bend and it was mediocre. We set an amount in our minds that if we made $xx that we wouldn't be really disappointed. We made that amount plus $6. Oh well. No fluff money, but it pays the bills.</p>

<p>Darlene talked to other artists who said sales are still down across the board. Sales on Main Street here haven't picked up much either. Indeed, the downturn has forced another business to close. </p>

<p>My mom is now visiting for about 12 days. We went to Louisville today to drop off some pots at the <a href="www.kentuckycrafts.org">Kentucky Museum of Art+Design</a> for jurying. We have an outside shot at getting into their museum gallery store. We got a sneak peak at a ceramics exhibit there that's rather nice. We also looked at a lot of street sculpture and saw a glass blowing demo at GlassWorks. A satisfying day.</p>

		<h2>06.05.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Buying a car and John Kerry</h3>
	
	<p>Sometime this year we'll probably buy a used vehicle. Doing a little research into the matter has led me to believe that may be a frustrating experience.</p>

<p>Indeed, I'm starting to empathize a bit with John Kerry. The GOoPers wailed on him for saying he didn't own an SUV, but that his family did. I'm actually starting to think I know how he feels.</p>

<p>We own two vehicles-- a minivan that definitely needs replaced and an ugly red Ford cargo van that we use to go to fine art festivals. </p>

<p>I'm extremely jealous of the jewelers who can shove their wares and display into a small station wagon. We, on the other hand, have at least 222 cubic feet of pots to haul in a van that gets 10 mpg in the city and 15 on the highway.</p>

<p>I hate burning that much fuel to begin with, but it's outright painful at $2 a gallon.</p>

<p>We'll probably keep the big van for shows, but something smaller for day-to-day use and taking pots to galleries.</p>

<p>I'd like to get a station wagon that gets decent gas mileage.<br />
But Darlene, on the other hand, likes being able to get up off the road and see what's going on around her.</p>

<p>I can see her point of view. When I first started driving in my 76 Chevy Vega, I had a pretty good view of the road. Within the past 10 years it seems everyone has purchased an SUV or some other assorted monster truck. Now in order to get the same view of the road, you almost have to buy a monster yourself. It's a mean cycle. </p>

<p>Indeed, a couple of times recently we've driven borrowed or rented compact cars and the sight from down below is scary. Not only does it suddenly feel odd  to have my butt inches from the ground, but it's scary to see the hubcaps of an SUVs roaring by. Hmmm, what chance does this Chevy Prism have against the Ford Expedition next to me?</p>

<p>Mind you, there are cars coming out that suit both of our purposes. The Pontiac Vibe rides higher, has a bit of cargo space and gets decent mileage. Some of the smaller SUVs like the Santa Fe do OK in the mileage category as well. But alas, we don't have $20,000 to buy either.</p>

<p>So we're back to square one. Either I have to suffice with 18 city/24 highway (admittedly better than 10/15) or Darlene has to sit closer to the ground while she's driving.</p>

<p>I think I've lost this bet and we're looking at another minivan. At least we'll be using the cargo space on a regular basis unlike many SUV drivers who occupy maybe 10% of the vehicle.</p>

<p>Nonetheless I understand how John Kerry feels. I'm sure he'd love to drive a Prius, but his family wants to see the road. Obviously, he didn't win his bet either.</p>

	<h3>I'm either growing older ...</h3>
	
	<p>or I'm doing the wrong stretches before riding my bike.</p>

<p>When I press down on the peddles my knee tendons suddenly hurt. Putting the bike into a lower gear helps take the pressure off, but I'm sure I'm doing something wrong. </p>

<p>I think part of the problem is I stand a lot at the circulation desk and I'm letting my knees lock. Then when I bend down it's snap, crackle and pop. My shoes are comfortable, but I suspect they're not padded enough to be nice to my knees.</p>

<p>Thus, I need to find out what to do about my knees.</p>

<p>I suspect it's in the category of "doctor, heal thyself" but rather "reference assistant, stop complaining and look it up."</p>

	<h3>An interstitial message and back to work</h3>
	
	<p>Darlene and I took a mostly unexpected trip to Buffalo, New York, a couple weeks ago. My mom's husband died (my step-father) and we attended the memorial service and kept my mom company for a couple of days.</p>

<p>His son wrote a very nice piece for the service bulletin. When I get a change I'll post it and let you see the kind of man he was. I wish I had it to post before he died, but that's the nature of things I guess.</p>

<p>Either way, we've been playing catch up for a while and this blog has been on the back burner. For that I've felt a little guilty, but looking at the site statistics amplified that feeling.</p>

<p>I was originally checking the web statistics for my wife's <a href="http://www.mudcatpottery.com">website</a> to see if people were finding her pottery (it's getting there).</p>

<p>Then, out of curiosity (the reason I do most things) I checked my own stats. I only check it about once or twice a season as the statistics application was slow to use on a dial-up connection. </p>

<p>First I was surprised by the program. My host, <a href="http://www.1and1.com">1and1.com</a>, has really streamlined its control panel and now it just flies! Nice job guys. I got in on their free three-year deal, but if I had to renew today I definitely would.</p>

<p>Secondly, I thought traffic would drop if I stopped updating it on a regular basis. That apparently is not the case. Instead traffic is still climbing. In May, the site landed nearly 3000 "unique visitors."</p>

<p>Thus I feel a little guilty. When I visit my favorite blogs I expect new stuff to read. If traffic was going down I wouldn't feel guilty as there'd be fewer folks to disappoint. (Now that that's written it makes no sense).</p>

<p>Whatever, I guess I should get writing again.</p>

	<h3>Even cicadas like our library</h3>
	
	<p>I've heard people call Brood X an invasion. The cicadas are definitely in full force here in Madison and we are inundated with the red-eyed, vainy-winged bugs.</p>

<p>As the front door of our library opens, the buzz roars in and fades out as the door shuts once again.</p>

<p>That's been the scenario for the past 10 days. Today, however, I think the cicadas have finally realized what a cool library we have. They're riding their way in on the backs of our patrons.</p>

<p>This afternoon, a mom was checking out books as I was helping her daughter learn how to use Indiana's Virtual Library <a href="http://www.inspire.net">Inspire.net</a>. Suddenly, we heard a very loud chirping from across the reading room. The young woman's mother was jumping around clearly stunned. Soon, the poor woman realized there was a cicada in her purse. </p>

<p>Not three minutes later, I'm still helping the student find journal articles on viruses and an older gentleman walked in and started chirping as well. As he found one in his pocket, the two of us couldn't keep from laughing. He promptly dropped it on the floor and crunched it with his foot. Just what we needed, crushed cicada on our carpet.</p>

<p>An hour later, I was checking out some videos for a young man who suddenly grabbed at his neck and found a cicada crawling down the collar of his shirt. Even knowing he had it in his hand we both jumped when the thing started chirping. Those puppies are loud.</p>

<p>The buggers are falling from the trees, swarm at the lightest distraction and, unlike flies, know nothing of people, dogs, cars or anything else on earth for that matter. They're all over the sidewalks and streets, many dead having been stomped on or driven over. I had a couple "riding" on my bike. </p>

<p>They're even showing public displays of affection.  I now regularly see pairs of cicadas on top of each. I was suddenly glad not to have children at this immediate point. Not only would I have to explain the birds and the bees, but cicadas as well. </p>

<p>One of our patrons in this very boat said she was very happy when her kid readily settled for the answer of "they're mating." She's not sure if the child knew what the word meant, but was happy to not have to explain it.</p>

<p>While I'm glad we've visited by Brood X only once every 17 years, I'm enjoying the spectacle. </p>

<p>This morning I went to the Hanover College library to pick up some inter-library loan books that were mis-routed seven miles in the wrong direction. Hanover is a very leafy campus and it was evident from the holes in the ground that there were a few million bugs along with the 2,000 students. </p>

<p>The funny thing was the sound. There were so many of them that the overall aural feel of the cicada calls had changed. Instead of sounding like crickets on acid, the hum took on a whiring sound not unlike what you'd hear from space ships in 1950s sci-fi movies.</p>

<p>Hmmm, maybe we are being invaded.</p>

	<h3>New work on Mudcat Pottery website and other thoughts</h3>
	
	<p>For the fun of it Darlene and I have been making tiles as a sideline to her regular Mudcat work. I posted several of the tiles on her <a href="http://mudcatpottery.ontheriversedge.com/kiln/">Hot from the Kiln</a> page of her website.</p>

<p>Three of the tiles I actually created-- "Maneki Neko," "Hoosier Cat" and "Broadway Fountain Fish" The rest Darlene did and I'll post more of her tiles soon.</p>

<p>There's also a new hand-built carved box and mini-jar that I love.</p>

<p>I added the new pots as we waiting out the rain today. This is the second weekend of our Grand Open House. This weekend's been slower than last weekend (though everyone may be down in Louisville for the Kentucky Derby). However, we had one gentleman who bought seven pieces for wedding gifts-- that's a nice sale.</p>

<p>Also interesting article about fear in this month's Utne magazine. In the sidebar "7 ways to rethink fear" here are a couple of tidbits.<br />
<blockquote><b>Old thoughts</b>: If I act on what I believe, conflict will break out. I'll be humiliated and ineffective. New Thoughts: Conflict means engagement. Something is in motion. It's an opening, not a closing.</b></blockquote><br />
Maybe that can be a mantra for John Kerry... and me as well.</p>

	<h3>No she didn't</h3>
	
	<p>My mom recently read about my <a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/archives/000292.html">"slide incident."</a></p>

<p>I asked her if she ever warned me about running up slides. "No, I never told you not to." </p>

<p>At least I don't have to worry about disobeying my mother to boot. Being that dumb is bad enough.</p>

<p>The swelling in the upper lip is almost gone, but my nose still hurts.</p>

<p>For some reason it reminds me of a bike riding accident I had as a kid. </p>

<p>I was rolling over a railroad track that went at an angle to the street when my front tire got stuck on the rail. It threw me over the handlebars into a patch of tall reedy grass on the side of the street. </p>

<p>I was fine with one exception. One of the reeds went up my nose.</p>

<p>It turned out my dad had to take me to the hospital because the profuse bleeding just would not stop.</p>

<p>I guess if there's a lesson in any of that, it's to not carry a bag full of Richie Rich comic books while you're riding a bike over railroad tracks. I'm lucky the guy I borrowed them from was a friend, several ended up with blood on them.</p>

	<h3>Didn't your mother tell you not to run up slides?</h3>
	
	<p>I'm not sure, I don't remember. But experience certainly did last night.<br />
Actually, I lucked out as I narrowly avoided breaking my nose or my teeth.</p>

<p>We were at a picnic celebrating a friend leaving his job. I was playing tag with his kids and a few others hanging out at the playground. I went up a slide to chase one of the kids and slammed into the slide's metal hold bar. I never saw it-- of course it was painted the same color as the rest of the slide</p>

<p>I'm amazed it got it on the upper lip. A quarter inch up or down and I'd have been in the emergency room. My upper lip is a little split and definitely fat. But hey, my mustache hides the worst of it.</p>

<p>Mind you, the evening stayed in that mode. </p>

<p>One of their kids did a literal back flip off the merry-go-round learning his first lesson in centrifical force. He got back on, though holding on very tight, a few minutes later.</p>

<p>Later, while playing UNO, the "unjob" celebrant dropped his playing card in his pop. Darlene threw a paper wad at another friend and it landed in her pop (she couldn't have hit it if she tried). </p>

<p>At least his wife, who's expecting their third any day now, didn't go into labor.</p>

	<h3>snippets on 4.4.4</h3>
	
	<p>The old Chinese fortune cookie curse goes something like "You will lead an interesing life."</p>

<p>It has been that.</p>

<p>We went to our nephews wedding which was very nice and as we were about to pack, Darlene's father had a heart attack. We spent three days with family and in the hospital until her dad got out of the coronary care unit. He has more surgery in his future near and far, but he survived the attack with no damage to the heart because they got him to the hospital so quick.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we hoped to have a quiet weekend to catch up, but our friend Pat was in the mood to build and we now have three new sets of shelves in her studio and other sundry improvements to our building.</p>

<p>Meanwhile at work I've got a full slate of projects, I'll need to work on a massive to-do list because I can't keep it all in my mind. I'm astounded at how far I can fall behind having missed four days of work.</p>

<p>I also learned we were awarded the full amount of the grant I wrote for wireless Internet at the library. We'll be able to offer it to the public as well as make access easier for staff. We'll indeed be a hot spot.</p>

<p>On the pottery side, Darlene's planning a <a href="www.mudcatpotterycom">Grand Open House</a> for the end of the month in her studio. She's cleaning like a madwoman and plans to make pots like crazy as well. There should be some fun stuff coming out of the kilns so stop by if you can.</p>

	<h3>We've been busy</h3>
	
	<p>The last few days have been a flurry of construction at our building. We took down a partition wall to give Darlene more space in her studio. Actually, our friend Pat did the work, we were just gophers, haulers and 2 by 4 de-nailers.</p>

<p>We also replaced some drainlines in the basement. Our building was a restaurant at one time and the drainline was all but clogged with grease (it was entirely clogged, but again Pat roto-routed it out enough to get it flowing.</p>

<p>Lifting the PVC pipe was like lifting a pipe of iron. Very odd.</p>

<p>At one point during the weekend we peaked up into the attic (one thing that oddly enough we never did before). We discovered that we have two roofs. One was built six feet above the first. The first didn't have much slope, very Federal style. Amazing stuff, but it'll be a pain if we ever need to replace the vent lines.</p>

<p>The only other excitement is finally getting our tax figures to our accountant.</p>

<p>Like an old amusement park commercial (Fantasy Island in New York during the 1970s) stated -- "Fun? Wow!!!"</p>

	<h3>Another day</h3>
	
	<p>Can't say I've been in the mood to blog lately, though I can't for say why at the moment.</p>

<p>We're busy at the library. I'm trying to get the March-April library newsletter together. Photography, Arbor Day activities (a whole month worth of tree stuff actually), our biannual a prose and poetry reading, a gourd program, tax help and "much, much more!"</p>

<p>Darlene is getting a bit more sunshine of late and I'm able to bike to work again. Temperatures are trending toward highs of 40s and we'll hit upper 50s this weekend. I can deal with that.</p>

<p>We're talking about the future with a capital F. We've come to the conclusion that it's a matter of being able to make actual choices as opposed to being forced to settle for the default. </p>

<p>While some of the possible choices have instilled a sense of fear at the boundaries of one's mind and spirit, I think any of the choices will force us out of our comfort zone and force us to grow. </p>

<p>It seems as we're starting to make those choices this century. We finally bought a building. I started a new job, possibly a new career. Darlene finally has her <i>own</i> studio.</p>

<p>Life's a highway. It's just a matter of avoiding the same fast food restaurants at each exit. Take care all.</p>

	<h3>Took a birthday break</h3>
	
	<p>I realized I hadn't posted in several days. I guess that's what happens when you're having too much fun. My birthday was Tuesday, turned a young pup 37.</p>

<p>It was a lot of fun. Everyone was spoiling me with cards, phone calls, a basket of fruit, an Apple iTunes Music Store gift certificate and 8 hours of pre-recorded Star Trek, along with assorted movies and music.</p>

<p>Obviously Darlene and I spent our last few nights watching Star Trek.</p>

<p>The iTunes Music Store could be dangerous. I had a ton of fun picking them out, but the download is slow I had to leave the modem running overnight to download the 19 songs. I'm in trouble if I ever get broadband Internet.</p>

<p>For the curious, here are the iTunes I bought. Mostly tunes I remembered from the 70s and 80s that I can't get locally.</p>
	
	<p>"Classical Gas" by Mason Williams<br />
"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic" by The Police<br />
"Fortress around Your Heart" by Sting<br />
"Hold Back the Rain" by Duran Duran<br />
"I Still Believe (Great Design)" by The Call<br />
"In Your Eyes" by Peter Gabriel<br />
"Last Night of the World" by Bruce Cockburn<br />
"Layla" by Derek & The Dominos<br />
"Lovers In a Dangerous Time" by Bruce Cockburn		<br />
"Mystery Man" The Outfield<br />
"Night Train" by Bruce Cockburn<br />
"Owner of a Lonely Heart" by Yes<br />
"Say It Isn't So" by The Outfield<br />
"Shine a Little Love" by Electric Light Orchestra<br />
"Since You're Gone" by The Cars<br />
"Since You've Been Gone" by The Outfield<br />
"Synchronicity 2" by The Police	<br />
"Valerie" by Steve Winwood<br />
"Your Love" by The Outfield</p>

<p>It's funny that the Cars and the Outfield tunes have nearly the same name. I didn't notice that until just now.</p>

	<h3>Toasty Oven</h3>
	
	<p>After months of waiting, we have a rudementary kitchen again. </p>

<p>We still don't have water, but we now have an oven and a microwave again. Admittedly we have to unplug the refrigerator to use either.</p>

<p>We love being able to eat fish again and baked a pizza and some cinnamon rolls. Boy I've missed having an oven.</p>

<p>The microwave meanwhile cooks things twice as fast as the 15-year-old model that caught fire last month. </p>

<p>It's amazing that we paid the same amount for this one as we did 15 years ago.</p>

	<h3>I love css, I hate css and boy it's cold</h3>
	
	<p>I've always heard that 3-column formats using css can be difficult. I'm learning so first hand. If I can debug this template, I'll be extremely happy. Nonetheless I love what css can do for a website. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we've been comfortable even though it got below 0 last night. I weatherized our apartment more this winter than last. Last year we were losing all our heat up the grand staircase to the third floor and we often needed four layers of blankets to stay warm. This year I put plastic along the staircase and the heat flows into the second floor instead. That and I found which windows were killing us.</p>

<p>It's actually gotten above 15 degrees out so if we're going to go for a walk, now is the time.</p>

	<h3>Up in a plume of flame and a poof of smoke</h3>
	
	<p>our microwave died today. May it's 2.6ghz soul rest in peace.</p>

<p>It's not surprising really as it hadn't been working well lately. However, its last symptoms were bizarre indeed.</p>

<p>We have a florescent light in our living/bedroom that hasn't worked properly for about six months now. This morning it was on and everything else in the apartment was barely running.</p>

<p>Our lights and our plugs are on two different circuits so it made no sense to me why when a light kicks on that our humidifier would kick off, but it did. We turned off the lights and the plugs would die. Turn on the lights and plugs come alive. These puppies are on two different circuits!</p>

<p>So we call our friend who's working on our electricity and he showed up within an hour.</p>

<p>After some messing around with the wiring we heard a huge pop and saw our microwave catch on fire with flames shooting out the bottom.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Darlene was right there and was able to cut the juice and the whole thing died in a huge poof of smoke. From that point on, everything was working in its normal fashion again. </p>

<p>As close as we can figure, the people who originally installed the electric put two hot wires and only one neutral in the same conduit. The surge from the microwave somehow bridged the two circuits.</p>

<p>Hmm, I wonder how much microwaves cost. We haven't been in the market for one for a while as we've had this one nearly as long as we've been married.</p>

	<h3>Vacation's here</h3>
	
	<p>Actually, I decided to consider it two back to back four-day weekends with a three day vacation in between. I won't be going back to work until Tuesday, Jan. 27.</p>

<p>Now it's a question of what am I going to do with myself. I've decided to upgrade my blog, if only for the heck of it. I'm reviewing a switch from Blogger to <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> which will allow me to have catagories for my posts among other interesting features.</p>

<p>I think I'll finally force myself to continue studying for the GRE. Bush might want to be on the moon or Mars by 2017, I can get my MLS by the time I'm 40.</p>

<p>There's some cleaning in my future! Wow! Some walks, naps, maybe a trip to Louisville. Some cards with friends, some reading.</p>

<p>Heading my reading list is a "Shadow of Death" by William Tapply, "A Handbook for Fighting Back" by James Carville and "Google Hacks."</p>

	<h3>Good fortune?</h3>
	
	<p>Darlene and I are suckers for eating Chinese. It's a cheap night out. For $5 we can both have a bowl of soup and an egg roll. For $10 we can stuff ourselves silly with Triple Delight, white rice, soup and egg roll.</p>

<p>Of course we snag fortune cookies. We open them at the same time and then we count down from three and try to snap them simultaneously.</p>

<p>Well, I've been getting a few interesting ones lately:</p>

<p>"Life to you is a dashing and bold adventure"<br />
"Be prepared to accept a wondrous opportunity in the days ahead!"<br />
"It's doing good with what you've got that lights the morning star."<br />
"You are interested in public service and would make an outstanding statesman."</p>

<p>Huh?!?!?</p>

<p>Well I opened a "fortune chocolate" today (a bunch of chocolate hearts packed in a Chinese food takeout container) and it said "keep your plans secret."</p>

<p>Then of course there are the lucky numbers. Here are some if you want to play the lottery. If you win, send me a tip.</p>

<p>6, 8, 16, 28, 21, 31<br />
64, 15, 13, 23, 8, 40<br />
16, 18, 21, 25, 29, 45<br />

	<h3>Things are a little blurry</h3>
	
	<p>If I look blurry-eyed tomorrow, it's not because I just woke up. It's because I am indeed blurry-eyed.</p>

<p>The screw on the left lens kept popping out and I thought I had it fixed with a new screw. But it too came out so Darlene used some string to hold it together. We were going to get them fixed today when the string broke. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can't find the lens. I just don't remember it falling out. I fear it happened while we were on our walk this afternoon and the lens is out on the street somewhere.</p>

<p>Worst case scenario I'm without my glasses until next week. I can order a replacement on Monday, but I may not get it for several days.</p>

<p>Thus I think I'll be the opposite of "bright-eyed and bushy-tailed" for a few days.</p>

	<p>My father-in-law went beyond the call of duty and spent at least 10 hours working on our cargo van (a.k.a. "The Beast" because it drives like one). </p>

<p>Our van didn't have heat as the motor died so he rigged up a 20-year-old RV heater that gave us a toasty ride all the way home. While he was at it, he discovered the floor board at our feet were rusted through. No wonder my feet were freezing. There so little metal down there. So he screwed metal down. To top it off he also put in a new motor in our existing heater so our defroster would work. </p>

<p>We spent $27 for parts the rest were odd and end spares he had hiding away in his three barns.</p>

<p>Boy do we owe him. That was an amazing gift.</p>

		<h2>12.21.03</h2>

	<p>During my recent readings of the news I have found myself to be more and more in the minority of opinion in America.</p>

<p>I'm apparently in the minority of folks who are in opposition to President Bush and his war against Iraq.</p>

<p>I'm in the minority of college educated white males who are Democrats let alone progressive.</p>

<p>I'm in the minority of people who use Macintosh computers.</p>

<p>But then there's the little things. I'm in the minority who want to preserve our civil rights. I just read an article that only 6 percent of Americans understand the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. No wonder noone is questioning the Patroit Act.</p>

<p>What makes it frustrating is I'm in one of the "red" states that is a "shoe-in" for Bush and to top it off we have a May primary date so I can't even get in my two-cents about who Bush's opponent should be. Thus my vote hardly counts for president. Voting for congress is as close as I can get.</p>

<p>Then of course there's the problem of Microsoft recommending "critical" updates for our library computers which in turn crashes the system.</p>

<p>No politics and computers don't really match up, but they both frustrate me nonetheless. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the only Democratic candidate who uses Macs is Al Sharpton. Is he a fascinating man because he uses a fascinating computer or do fascinating men use fascinating computers?</p>

	<p>For my friend and family with a sweettooth here's a great article from Wired Magazine about the elusive search for the perfect sugar substitute.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.11/newsugar.html">Hitting the Sweet Spot:</a> <br />
<blockquote>"Now comes a sweetener that does all the wannabes one better: It's natural. It actually is sugar. Unlike high-intensity artificial sweeteners, tagatose looks, tastes, and cooks like sugar. It's 92 percent as sweet as table sugar but with only 38 percent of the calories. Studies suggest it prevents weight gain and doesn't cause cavities. It's safe for diabetics and may even help combat the disease."</blockquote></p>

<p>It bakes well too! Low cal chocolate chip cookies? It's coming!<br />
 (OK, maybe not low cal compared to Special K, but still).</p>

	<p>I actually did something constructive last night. I started filling in the million nail holes and cracks left on the plaster walls over the past 150 years. It was actually kind of fun as scary as I find that.<br />
 <br />
My friend Pat the tinman is a strict preservationist and he'd kill me for scraping off the old wallpaper that's underneath. He'd prefer I uncovered as much as I could so he could reproduce it and put it back up. His friend is a printmaker and they could pull it off. Mind you he's been working on doing that with his house for a few years now, but is still working to redo the plaster.<br />
 <br />
Well, I'm only doing a quarter of the room to start. We'll experiment with paint colors on that before doing the whole room. Thus there will still be 3/4 of the room for him to play with. <br />
 <br />
I did manage to peel the paint off one of the wallpapers. It is a flower motif made out of red and white dots- a tacky impressionistic feel. Below that is a blue and gold wallpaper, though I haven't uncovered enough of that to figure out what it looks like.</p>

<p>No, the wallpaper isn't worth preserving. Pat believes they knew how do design back in the Victorian days. You just had to see everything and not judge it from one piece of wallpaper.</p>

<p>Some of it I don't mind. I could easily live in the house from "My Fair Lady" and I love old places, but I'll stick with my own interior colors thank you very much.<br />
 <br />
We're thinking of an a dark avacado with some sort of off white trim and ceiling for our living/bedroom. Our kitchen will be a warm golden yellow with the same trim. Maybe our hall will be a nice golden orange (or some such).<br />
 <br />
It'd be easier to get excited about doing the work if we didn't have leaking chimneys. We'll have to live with it for another few months. At least he's around working on our bathroom right now. Getting the plumbing figured out will be a huge jump (water in our kitchen, no taking baths in Darlene's glaze room).</p>

	<p>Here's a fascinating read from The Washington Post that answers the question<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A58554-2003Dec12?language=printer">"What will happen when a national political machine can fit on a laptop?"</a></p>

<blockquote>" ....For all Dean's talk about wanting to represent the truly "Democratic wing of the Democratic Party," the paradox is that he is essentially a third-party candidate using modern technology to achieve a takeover of the Democratic Party. Other candidates -- John Kerry, John Edwards, Wesley Clark -- are competing to take control of the party's fundraising, organizational and media operations. But Dean is not interested in taking control of those depreciating assets. He is creating his own party, his own lists, his own money, his own organization. What he wants are the Democratic brand name and legacy, the party's last remaining assets of value, as part of his marketing strategy."</blockquote>

<p>Everett Ehrlich, a former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs under President Bill Clinton, takes a mid-20th century economic theory about how "the cost of information dictates the size of the organization" and explains how it will greatly impact the future of politics in America.</p>

	<p>To avoid nightmares -- DON'T DRIVE IN THE FIRST SNOW OF THE SEASON!</p>

<p>Darlene and I went to Columbus, Indiana, last night which is about an hour's drive from here to drop off some pots at a gallery and to pickup the brochure I designed from the printers.</p>

<p>It wasn't too bad on the way up, people were driving slow, but that's to be expected. On the way home, however, that one hour drive became a 2-1/2 hour drive. </p>

<p>I knew the roads were starting to get a bit slick because you'd feel a little slipping on starting and stopping. I saw a salt truck behind me so I pulled off in order to drive on the salt. I turned off and started to turn around when sliiiide-bang. I kissed a cement retaining wall in front of a church. Fortunately I was only going 3-5mph. I bent the bumper, but I lucked out in that it didn't puncture the tire (an inch away). I was able to pull the bumper out enough to keep going with no problems.</p>

<p>For the next 90 minutes everyone was driving 15-20 mph on a state highway. People were spun out on the sides of the road. An instant later two cars ahead of me a guy going north spins out into our lane and ends up going south. I saw it and slowed down in time, but I'm amazed the guy in front of me didn't get plastered.</p>

<p>Once traffic let up, things were better and I was going a nice slow and consistant 35. The roads got a little better as we went south.</p>

<p>Then I made the mistake of assuming the state highway garage had plowed one of our steep hills going into downtown Madison. It was SLICK. A woman had spun out big time, blocking the road and I was the first to come up behind her. She was screaming that she didn't know how to get out of the slide area. Meanwhile, our van was slipping all over the place and I narrowly avoided slidding into another car next to me.</p>

<p>We finally got down the hill in low gear and I thought we were home free when a guy came flying up the street making an opposite left at the same time I was. Out of the corner of my eye I saw him spin out and barely managed to move out of getting hit in the rear end.</p>

<p>That would have been one thing, but then instead of letting me have my right-of-way, he peeled out going the same way I was and turned fast down the next block. As it was now midnight I wonder if he was drunk.</p>

<p>Thus the nightmare and the lesson learned... don't drive in the season's first snow.</p>

	<p>Bob Herbert of The New York Times in his column <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/12/opinion/12HERB.html">No Will to Win?</a> seems to nicely wrap up the panic and division in the Democratic Party right now.</p>

<p>It amazes me how the Democratic "establishment" is freaking over Gore's endorsement of Dean. For better or worse I'd have to agree with Gore that Dean's the only man with a plan to win. </p>

<p>I'd like to see how his campaign develops over the next couple of months. How he moves from dark horse mode to thoroughbred mode will be telling.</p>

<p>Can he move to the center before Bush tars him as a left winger? Mind you how can a fiscal conservative, pro-states rights person be labeled as a left-winger?</p>

<p>He's been quoted as saying "Let's not elect a president based on God, gays and guns" I think the rest of the sentence was something to the effect of "but rather good jobs, good education for our children and health care for all."  The problem is I've rarely seen the second in the press. </p>

<p>The Republicans will focus on the "G's" to avoid talking about the rest of it, but they have hit on issues people care about. How will Dean address those issues? Here's a <a href="http://www.deanforamerica.com/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=10881&JServSessionIdr004=bi5oco74x1.app193a&security=1&news_iv_ctrl=1321">speech he gave in South Carolina recently</a> that hints at an answer.</p>

<p>But it's too early to answer these questions, thus let's wait a couple of months before anointing someone. Whomever does win needs to have, as Herbert states, a huge will to win.</p>

	<p>Our library's applying for a grant that will give the library $1,850 worth of books, videos, CD-ROM and brochures about urban trees. April of next year will be tree month at the library and we'll host programs and help out with the city's Arbor Day celebration.</p>

<p>Darlene and I go to the celebration each year. It's a lot of fun with Smoky Bear and maple cake and elementary school students doing treeish things. </p>

<p>Last year, the local landscaping-tree care company did demonstrations of trimming dead limbs and felled a dead tree. The kids were wide eyed as the dead limbs came down with splattering and slintering thunks. Watching them do their work suspended 30-40 feet up was impressive.</p>

<p>Mind you, later a few tree theorists debated whether it was a good thing to cut down dead trees and limbs in a park setting as they are usually inhabited by wildlife of all sorts.</p>

<p>At our grant planning meeting today, the city arborist/naturalist, a dear friend of ours, said there won't be any "felling" of trees this year. Another said in a mock gasp-- "oh, the f-word."</p>

<p>Another person got on her amazing soap box about how people go to museums to ooh and ahh over twisted sculpture when they can go into nature and see Gods very same work in dead trees.</p>

	<p>**I wrote to Clarion University and they're not sure when the next cohort is starting. The professor I wrote to was supposed to ask her chair whether a new class would start in 2005. It'd be perfect if it'd work. I'll just wait and see.</p>

<p>**We have book and video drops at our front door where anyone can make a quick drop off. A teenager dropped off his book and while the drawer was open screamed "YEAH!" into the box.

	<p>Between two botched wars, pork barrel giveaways that'd make the Democrats blush, and regressive labor and environmental policies, the Bush administration and Congress is getting me growly. </p>

<p>That alone would be one thing, but then they get hypocritical and moan about little things.</p>

<p>Take this past weekend for example. </p>

<p>Sen. John Kerry finally did something in his campaign that wasn't stilted. For months, he's been stymied by the question of why he voted for the Iraq War. In a Rolling Stone interview, he finally gave an answer that made sense and didn't hem and haw.</p>

<p>Mind you, it may be too late for him. Former Vt. Gov. Howard Dean is running a campaign unlike any witnessed before and he appears to be on a roll. He's 30 points up in the latest New Hampshire polls.</p>

<p>Here's what happened (according to an AP article):</p>

<blockquote>
WASHINGTON (AP--Dec.  7) - In an interview in the latest Rolling Stone magazine, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry used profane language to assess President Bush's Iraq policy, and Bush's chief of staff said Sunday the Democratic presidential candidate was out of line.

<p>When asked in the interview about the success of rival candidate Howard Dean, whose anti-war message has resounded with supporters, Kerry responded: "When I voted for the war, I voted for what I thought was best for the country. Did I expect Howard Dean to go off to the left and say, 'I'm against everything?' Sure. Did I expect George Bush to f*** it up as badly as he did? I don't think anybody did."</p>

<p>The expletive drew a rebuke from White House, which suggested an apology might be in order.</p>

<p>"That's beneath John Kerry," the president's chief of staff, Andrew Card, said on CNN.</p>

<p>"I'm very disappointed that he would use that kind of language," Card said. "I'm hoping that he's apologizing at least to himself, because that's not the John Kerry that I know."</p>

<p>The Kerry campaign said the Massachusetts senator had no regrets.</p>

<p>"John Kerry saw combat up close, and he doesn't mince words when it comes to politicians who put ideological recklessness ahead of American troops," said spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter. "I think the American people would rather Card and the rest of the White House staff spend more time on fixing Bush's flawed policy in Iraq than on Senator Kerry's language."<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>The whole thing is funny really because Bush has used the very same language. I did a search on the net on came up with these examples which were from newspaper articles and columns:</p>

<p>Bush told Condi Rice "F*** Saddam, we're taking him out." </p>

<p>In front of his own daughters Bush told Wall Street Journal Washington Bureau Chief Al Hunt: "You no good f***ng son of a bitch. I will never f***ing forget what you wrote."?</p>

<p>At a '99 fundraiser candidate Bush said his goal as President would be to "reverse all the f***ups of the Clinton administration and then f*** the Democrats over."? This was in front of the press.</p>

<p>Bush 5, Kerry 1. Draw your own conclusions.</p>

	<p>I'm still hoping to go to graduate school next year, but I came to the conclusion I wasn't looking forward to the four hour round trip drive to Indianapolis every week for two years. We just don't have a vehicle that'd handle that kind of driving (let alone a driver).</p>

<p>A couple of people had encouraged me to look at distance education. I had looked a couple of programs but they were all at least twice as expensive due to out of state tuition and required site visits (five days during the summer and a weekend each semester was typical).</p>

<p>Well I found a new one last night.  <a href="http://www.clarion.edu/edu-humn/newlibsci/index.htm">Clarion University of Pennsylvania</a> has just started a web-based program oriented toward rural librarianship (that's interesting in and of itself).</p>

<p>There doesn't appear to be site visits (save travel and housing costs), but if it does we have friends who live just an hour away.</p>

<p>Also the costs are only $1,500 more per year than Indianapolis and I'd save at least that much by not have to pay for gas and food every week. For some reason, they charge out-of-state distance learning only 102% of regular tuition (just don't take a class on campus or they'll smack your bursar's account one good).</p>

<p>The only downsides so far is each cohort (a group of students who will take the classes together over the two year period) is limited to 25 students. The very first cohort starts next month with the second starting in January 2005. If I can get in that might be just about perfect as far as timing goes.</p>

<p>I sent away for information, we'll see what it looks like.</p>

	<p>This morning I was complaining to a cohort that it was too quiet at the library. Not again.</p>

<p>This afternoon was an absolute madhouse. Some kids managed to surf the net with our online catalog machine that allegedly had security on it to prevent surfing. A keyboard died. An Internet novice wanted to search for Florida properties before their vacation. We had a "Wizard of Oz" marionette show and all the kids returned and got more books (including an entire 3rd grade class). A couple salesmen called. It was non-stop.</p>

<p>As Darlene would say "Now you wouldn't want to be bored now would you?"</p>

	<p>I've always been a fan of sports team nicknames. At one point a few years back (for some reason) I collected every team name I could find. Finding the stories behind the names would have been a fun task, but apparently Emerson Houk beat me to the punch with his book<a href="http://www.indystar.com/articles/9/098706-4639-047.html">"Go Huskies! Beat Felix the Cat!"</a></p>

<p>It should prove to be entertaining, the link is to an Indy Star article. Here's a snipet:</p>

<p>"Houck didn't realize just how peculiar and possibly telling a mascot could be until just a few years ago, when he and his wife were meandering toward St. Louis...</p>

<p>He loved being greeted by signs that announced he was entering, say, "Austin: Where Eagles Soar." He liked the display of pride.</p>

<p>He was struck particularly when, heading to St. Louis, he pulled into the Illinois town of Teutopolis, "Home of the Wooden Shoes." The same day he found himself in Effingham, "Home of the Flaming Hearts," and then to Vandalia, "Home of the Vandals," Roxanna, "Home of the Shells," and finally, Centralia, "Home of the Orphans."</p>

<p>"That's when I dug in," Houck says. He says that in 1922, Centralia had a basketball team that reached the state championship in Champaign, where a sportswriter wrote that the Centralians "played like champs but looked like orphans."</p>

<p>The school, which did not then have a mascot, embraced the snub.</p>

<p>Years later, when girls' teams came into being, those teams were not the "Lady Orphans," they were the "Annies."</p>

<p>Fun stuff</p>

	<p>It never fails ... when I think work is about to get boring-- snow starts to fall in hell followed by thunderstorms of cats and dogs (who then proceed to fall in love and form political parties). </p>

<p>This is not in a bad thing, mind you. Rather it reminds me what I like about working in a library-- you never know what you'll end up doing next.</p>

<p>It's just that I'm suddenly finding that I have more on my plate than I can keep track of. </p>

<p>I need some method of keeping track of my to-do list that I'll actually keep track of. Scraps of paper simply did not do the job. Notebooks are a little better, but not very flexible. Keeping notes on computer would work if I actually had a single computer. I'd be tempted to try using a PDA, but I don't know if I'd take the time to write in the entries every time something new pops up.</p>

<p>Hmm, I'm running out of options here. Suggestions taken, though simple orders of "get organized!" will be immediately be trashed.</p>

	<p>An interesting bill has just passed the Indiana Senate requiring library budgets to be approved by the county councils.</p>

<p>Currently, the library has its own taxing district and its own "appointed" board. This board approves the budget each year without input from elected officials.</p>

<p>A state senator was mad that the Allen County-Fort Wayne libraries passed a construction bond to rebuild the county's libraries without oversight from an elected body.</p>

<p>My director said one option being considered for a lobbying effort by the Indiana Library Federation is to transform library boards from appointed to elected boards.</p>

<p>The only downside I can see at the moment would be from an intellectual freedom standpoint. People with an axe to grind could easily become a board member and make life miserable for its director and staff. On the other hand, it could bring a higher profile to the library and give people more a vested interest.</p>

<p>There are a lot of details about the bill I'm unfamiliar with, but it could be interesting to see what happens.</p>

<p>Here's an <a href="http://www.indystar.com/articles/2/095784-8872-009.html">article</a> about the proposed bill.</p>

	<p>On the way home from Thanksgiving, Darlene and I visited a pretty amazing supermarket in Fairfield, Ohio, about 4 miles north of I-275, the loop around Cincinnati on S.R. 4.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.junglejims.com">Jungle Jim's</a> has an *astounding* selection of international foods -- 26,000 items from 60 countries. </p>

<p>There are major departments such as beer and wines, produce, meat and cheese, but the main part of the store is organized by nation and region. The selection in any individual department is pretty amazing, but together it's awe inspiring.</p>

<p>The produce selection takes up an acre and is very fresh. The following list give you the idea as to how lost I was looking at this stuff-- Boniato, Mogua, Bitter Melon, Daikon, Nappa, Ginger Root, Bread Casabe, Calabaza Squash, Calabacta, Opu Squash, Cilantro, Sugar Cane, Gai Choy, Yuchoy, and Lemon Grass.</p>

<p>Those with a sweet tooth should be please as each country aisle had a candy section. We found our favorite Dutch mints there-- King's Extra Strong. I heard they even have insect candy.</p>

<p>We need to take a chunk of cash with us one of these times so we can experiment with the food. It's too easy to only buy only what you're familiar with.</p>

	<p>We had Thanksgiving Dinner at Darlene's younger sister's house tonight. Nearly the whole family showed up (about 30). I played made up games with the neices and nephews and ate plenty of good food. This year's home grown turkey came in at 41 pounds.</p>

<p>It's not a Thanksgiving, however, unless we get to play football.</p>

<p>We played what Devin (a high school football player) calls Farm Football-- Out in the pasture with cow patties to make things interesting (as well as plenty of puddles from today's constant rain). My team couldn't catch the ball, but we managed a good running game and won 3 to 2. The last two touchdowns came at the onset of darkness. We used the darkness to run sneaky plays-- they had no idea who had the ball until it was too late.</p>

<p>Mind you, the flavor of the game came from the two llamas at the 20 yard line and the cow in the end zone.</p>

<p>Happy Thanksgiving family and friends</p>

<p>For those who play UNO, here's a great house rule we were introduced to tonight.</p>

<p>When a draw two or draw four is played, the next player can match it and so can the next. The player who can't match it is stuck with picking up the draws for all the matching cards. <br />
Tonight we had four draw twos in a row so the fifth player had to pick up eight cards.</p>

<p>Darlene and I played draw fours so the next player picked up eight and then and I picked a color that forced the player after that to pick another eight cards because she couldn't match the color.</p>

<p>It's a pretty mean rule, but boy was it fun.</p>

	<p>A few days ago I was wondering what the scoop was with this warm weather. I guess it was just Mother Nature's way of either a) giving us one last hurrah or b) spoiling us and then yanking it away hard.</p>

<p>I think it'd depend on whether you were a half-cup full or empty sort. For those not paying attention we hit the 70s this weekend and here's what's around the corner....</p>

<p>Tonight: Snow possible after 5am. Occasional rain. Low near 34. Winds SW between 18-20 mph, with gusts as high as 40 mph. <br />
 <br />
 Monday: Snow possible until 11am. Mostly cloudy, then gradually becoming mostly sunny, with a high around 36. <br />
 <br />
 Monday Night: Clear, with a low around 21. Wind chill values as low as 15. </p>

<p>So... after 70s is this "a" or "b"???</p>

		<h2>11.22.03</h2>
	

	
	<h3></h3>
	
	<p>The birthday party (prior post) capped a wild weekend. It was surprising considering the quiet week.</p>

<p><b>On the frustrating side,</b> I've been working on a four-page 11x15 brochure for the local historic preservation organization. It's going to look rather nice. I'll post a pdf of it when I get a chance. However, the information I received from the printer the first time didn't quite match what they told me the second time. As a result I hit a brick wall. </p>

<p>The first time they simply gave me measurements, the second time they said they had a template they preferred I use-- they're not the same. Similarly, the first time I was supposed to convert the document to a pdf, the second time they said just send the original document. That also meant I needed to change the fonts I was using (in hind sight I could have guessed as much). Unfortunately, I did not have those fonts and had to bug a friend for copies to use on the project.</p>

<p>It's back on track, but I lost a weekend of time.</p>

<p><b>Meanwhile</b>, our friend the tinsmith calls to have me bring by some of his work (we're selling his tinware from our studio) and two bottles of wine to his house ASAP. </p>

<p>He said he hit paydirt at match.com and found a date from Cincinnati-- a cute 47-year-old who believes in syncronicity. All week apparently she had been humming a certain song about the tinman from "The Wizard of Oz" and then meets a "tinman" on match.com. </p>

<p>They chatted online for four hours that night and he was smitten. She agreed to come down to Madison-- thus the wine.</p>

<p>He called the next day to say they sat up talking until 5:30 the next morning. That's all I know because our phone battery went dead. I'm sure I'll hear about it sometime.</p>

<p><b>Nice long hike</b>. Having given up on reaching the tinman (he was probably off on his next phone call) we went out an hiked at Clifty Falls for a couple of hours. The park is so different after the leaves fall. The trails are trickier as the roots and rocks are covered in leaves. However, you can see all the way from the rock outcroppings down to Clifty Creek and to the far side of the canyon. The views are simply unavailable from March-October.</p>

<p>The effects of the rock concert are finally wearing off so maybe I can sleep.</p>

	<p>We now know what an 18-year-old's birthday party is like. </p>

<p>Often adults get invited to such parties to keep the parents company, but we were invited by the 18-year-old himself who has kind of adopted us as honorary aunt and uncle (though the parents were glad to have company nonetheless).</p>

<p>We showed up late and missed most of the parlor games. Then again, that may have been a good thing. We did catch the tail end of one game where everyone kneels in a circle passing around a playing card... with their lips.<br />
You hold the card up to your mouth and suck in air to hold the card to your lips and try to pass it to the next person who in turn tries to suck the card to their lips. I overheard the rules stipulate if you dropped the card you had to kiss that person. I did not, however, witness this in practice.</p>

<p>However, we did show up in time for the rock concert. Carl, the birthday boy, plays bass in a band with a few friends and they played a short set of pretty decent punk rock at full throttle in the living room. The floors vibrated as did my rib cage. The concert was capped by a Jimi Hendrix-style rendition of "Happy Birthday" with everyone screaming the lyrics.</p>

<p>Then there was the entertaining black and white cat. One guy was wearing pants about six inches to long and ripped at the foot. The cat would follow his feet and pounce on his pants. Later, Darlene took a breather from the concert to find the cat on the dining room table eating the birthday cheese cake.</p>

<p>Entertaining indeed.</p>

	<p>The library due date stamp is telling me December is less than two weeks off. The holiday shopping season is right around the corner. We've already picked names for "Secret Santa" here at the library. Darlene's mother has already asked us what we want for Christmas. </p>

<p>Yet, it's 64 degrees outside and it's supposed to get upto 70 by Sunday. </p>

<p>What's wrong with this picture?</p>

	<p>As winter approaches, I thought y'all would appreciate this study:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/11/031106051159.htm">ScienceDaily News Release: Hot Cocoa Tops Red Wine And Tea In Antioxidants; May Be Healthier Choice</a>: </p>

<p>"Using special analytical techniques to evaluate the total antioxidant content in each beverage, the researchers showed that, on a per serving basis, the antioxidant concentration in cocoa was the highest: It was almost 2 times stronger than red wine, 2-3 times stronger than green tea, and 4-5 times stronger than that of black tea.</p>

<p>For those who want the tasty treat but also want to avoid extra sugar and dairy products that are common additives to cocoa, healthier alternatives are possible: Skim or soy milk can substitute for regular milk, while an artificial sweetener can replace the sugar. </p>

<p>Although you can enjoy cocoa either hot or cold, the hot version tends to trigger the release of more antioxidants than its cold counterpart, the researcher says. "</p>

	<p>One thing that's always amazed me about the Ohio River is that it almost has a personality of its own and casts a mood upon the day.</p>

<p>Some days it seems angry with waves whipped upon roily water. Other times clouds hover over its surface like a veil. This morning you couldn't see it at all for the fog.</p>

	<p>The downtown is slowly getting into the mood for Christmas. All the lightposts and the Broadway Fountain are wrapped in yellow lights and bows. The merchants have redesigned their store windows.</p>

<p>There was an open house downtown Friday night to kick off the holiday season, but only a few people managed to find their way down to Darlene's studio. Earlier in the evening their didn't appear to be much of a crowd, but I heard there were more people later.</p>

<p>Instead, I went to take tickets and sell concessions for the local theater group. They had three one-act plays-- the first was performed by the kids troupe, the second by 20- and 30- somethings and the third for the senior set. Good stuff.</p>

<p>Other than that, Darlene and I mostly worked. I'm still trying to finish the print project, but I'm getting close. More and more pots are slowly coming out of the kilns as a result we may try to get a fourth outlet before Christmas.</p>

	<p>Darlene came up to bed after checking her kiln for the last time tonight sniffing a handful of her hair. "I must remember to put my hair up when the kiln is on," she said.</p>

<p>She was leaning over next to the kiln and strands of her hair ended up going in a peep hole (a hole in the kiln that accordingly allows you to "peep" in). The kiln being over 1000 degrees, you can guess what happened.</p>

	<p>Everyone down here in the historic district is anxious as the date to pay property taxes is fast approaching. Our taxes went up about 30 percent, but many of our friends had their property taxes double and triple as a result of the state switching to "market value" property assessment.</p>

<p>The Indiana House Ways and Means Committee <a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/localnews/2003/11/13in/wir-front-itax1113-8039.html">held hearings</a> here in Madison yesterday to see how the change is impacting historic communities. A larger than usual number of properties are for sale down here as people are wanting to get out of the taxes.</p>

<p>As Benjamin Franklin said on this date in 1789-- "In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes."</p>

	<p>I attended the annual meeting of the Indiana Visual-Audio Network today. I was appointed to it's overall board of directors by our library board (all member libraries get to appoint a member). </p>

<p>It's no big deal really. The only chore is to attend an annual meeting to brainstorm and rubberstamp some of the stuff the executive committee drafts such as the annual budget.</p>

<p>We had a nice lunch, I won an audio book as a door prize (darn-didn't get the DVD player) and did a tour of the brand new (and extremely impressive) Indianapolis Star printing plant.</p>

<p>During the brainstorming session I opened my mouth a couple of times and later when they were trying to fill a vacancy on the executive committee, one of the directors said "Hey Jerry, why don't you do it."</p>

<p>Would my director let me? will they pay me or is this volunteer? errrr---let me think about this. The past-president later pulled me aside to half-begged me to try it. I'll talk to my boss tomorrow. It'd be one day a month committment. It wouldn't be bad at all if I were within an hour of Indy, but four hours of driving for two hours of meeting is a bear. What's the phrase--make a suggestion and you volunteered?</p>

<p>For what it's worth IVAN is a state authorized library cooperative to circulate multimedia packages to member libraries (i.e.--we get a package of 40 videos for eight weeks and then ship them to the next library and get a fresh set of 40 videos. It's a nice for smaller libraries).</p>

	<p>The doctor's appointment was mostly harmless. </p>

<p>Indeed, the doctor and I spent most of our time talking about politics and health care policy. He's a guy about my age, so it's interesting getting his perspective. </p>

<p>Either way, I'll have one mole that's only a little suspicious removed. Normally, he'd ignore it, but with the history of my dad and previous moles coming back suspect,we'll quickly snatch off anything that looks odd. Thus I suspect I may be knifed regularly for years to come.</p>

	<p>The last time I went in for a skin cancer screening, they took off several moles. I'm not a fan of needles or knives in any fashion, but I braved through two rounds of slicing and stitches (pretty good for someone who used to scream bloody murder at the site of a needle when I was a kid and would turn blue at the thought as a teen). Thank God for local anestetic.</p>

<p>The doctor told me to show up every six months and of course it is now six months.<br />
Darlene started bugging me about it at 5.5 months and I told her not to bug me until November as that's six months. So she kept her word and didn't bug me until the first week of November. Being the adult I now am, I kept my word and immediately called to make an appointment.</p>

<p>I said any day, whatever's convenient for the doctor. She picked today at 11. </p>

<p>Now the good Lord has been working in mysterious ways of late, dropping hints about life, the universe and everything about everywhere I've been looking. I wonder if he's at it again as 11-11 was my Dad's birthday who in turn died of cancer. hmmmm.....</p>

<p>"There is definitely some entertainment to locating the pottery downtown.  I was in the midst of throwing when out of the corner of my eye I saw something in the window.

	<p>Another tale from the library for you... I just wish I heard these juicy nuggets first hand.</p>

<p>A gentleman told Julie (our cataloger) that he accidently left left his lights on and killed the battery. He held up his door lock key fob and said without the battery that his automatic door opener wouldn't work and that he just couldn't get into his car.</p>

<p>Julie looked at looked at him puzzle and said "your keys wouldn't work?"</p>

<p>"Oh... I didn't think of that..."</p>

<p>She told me that she hesitated to say the obvious, but hey a librarian is there to serve the patron. I hope she marked that down as a reference question.</p>

<p>He then set the car on our circulation desk.</p>

<p>It was a very nice car with doors that opened and a steering wheel that turns the whole front assembly and a nice v-8 under the hood. </p>

<p>Obviously it was a nice scale model toy. He said it was literally in the street sitting in a parking space.</p>

<p>It's hard to say if we're being teased or if this really happened. But, I can't imagine our mailman ponying up the cash just to spin us a yarn.</p>

	<h3></h3>
	
	<p>The weather indeed got cooler, but it is still within the pleasent fall weather range so far. This weekend I may not say the same as it won't get out of the 40s.</p>

<p>For better or worse, I've come to somewhat dread Wednesday evenings in the children's room. I really enjoy helping the kids and parents find books and info, but I just don't get enough of it. Instead it's more like shelving books in the dungeon. It wouldn't be so bad if there was someone around, but it gets a little too quiet and lonely down there. I guess I'm too much of a people person.</p>

<p>The number of children's programs has been consistantly growing and with that the number of books flying out of the library is growing. Accordingly, the number of books to shelve gets larger as well. Actually, the library in general has been getting much busier, if the amount of shelving we're having to constantly do is an indication, our circulation is up. It'll be interesting to see the October stats that should be coming out any day now.</p>

<p>Either way, I got back to the library only to face two huge carts of books-- no I didn't get them all shelved. No one showed up to see the movie ("African Queen"- another movie I'd love to see on the big screen) and the children's room was again quiet.</p>

<p>I did get to show a mother how to set up a blog for her kid. She was hoping to get her son into a writing workshop we're holding, but one of the volunteers didn't show so we had to cut the registration off early. Instead, I suggested the son create a blog as it's certainly cooler than keeping a diary or journal. I figure getting any writing out of him would be a start. She liked the idea and will see how it goes.</p>

<p>That was the sole question on the night until Darlene surprised me at 8:40 and kept me company and helped me shelve books the last few minutes. We then slowly walked home in the autumn air and had a nice conversation punctuated by the kind of hugs on Main Street that has people calling us "those silly love birds." Maybe not, but you get the idea.</p>

	<p>My day is apparently going to parallel the weather today. It started out beautiful and warm and is supposed to finish rainy and cold.</p>

<p>Darlene and I enjoyed our morning basking in the spring like breeze coming in our bed/living room (one and the same) windows.</p>

<p>I got to work and first thing off, the zipper on my new pants breaks (I guess that's what I get for buying an $11 pair of pants), I get a headache, I end up on a computer that hasn't been updated for security patches since Bush was elected president and was infected with the blaster worm to boot.</p>

<p>Now I'm trying to do a tape drive backup our server and the computer is not recognizing the tape.</p>

<p>But, hey Darlene was sweet and brought me another pair of pants so I didn't have to go around stitched together with safety pins all afternoon. Safety pins for a zipper simply does not feel safe.</p>

<p>However, lately most of my clients have been wanting to update their sites more often than I have time to serve them. I guess that's the downside of taking too many clients when you're moonlighting.</p>

<p>As a solution I'm started writing custom blogs they could update on their own. Unfortunately, the blog templates were all written in a different language. So here I am again, learning a new language from scratch.</p>

<p>Cascading Style Sheets are easy enough to understand on the face of it all, but I'm still trying to figure out why one combination of code works and another doesn't. It'd probably help if I just got a book. You wouldn't know I worked in a library.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I've been spending hours playing with this site. Which, as several of you can tell, is a good chunk different from yesterday. </p>

<p>Am I:</p>

<p>a) being an incorrible geek? </p>

<p>b) procrastinating on a paying print project that isn't working the way I want it to?</p>

<p>c) procrastinating relearning math, algebra and geometry in preparation for the Graduate Record Exam?</p>

<p>d) all the above and much much more.</p>

	<p>This <a href="http://www.metaphy.com/Rays/rays4.html#anchor297845">article</a> contemplating an owner's manual for life is a little metaphysical for my tastes, but it hits on something I've often wondered. Wouldn't it be cool if everyone came with a user's manual? Then we'd have fewer disagreements and would be more fulfilled.</p>

<p>Maybe, maybe not. It would certainly undermine the enjoyment of learning about someone. Then again, I never read the instructions for a computer program unless I have to. But knowing it's there helps immensely.</p>

<p>Thus, if your fellow human is constantly bombing and giving you the "blue screen of death." Wouldn't it be nice to pull out their manual to help with the diagnostics and provide tips to avoid the situation in the future?</p>

<p>OK, mine might look like this...</p>

<p><b>Troubleshooting guide:</b><br />
If-- human's main processor starts fuzzing out.<br />
Sign of -- dehydration and/or lack of fuel to the brain.<br />
Solution -- a glass of water and/or a little food.</p>

<p><b>Maintenance schedule:</b><br />
Regular maintenance is required for this human. To insure continued optimal operation, do the following.<br />
*Hugs at both regular and irregular intervals. Does not need excuses.<br />
*Feed every 5 hours. Water every 2 hours.<br />
*Take for road trip at least once every 21 rotations of the earth.</p>

<p>At a loss for thoughts-- my main processor is indeed fuzzy and the solution is on the burner --I asked Darlene what else would be in my manual.</p>

<p>She grinned.</p>

<p>"Rated G please."</p>

<p>"Okay, I guess that about covers it."</p>

<p>Hmm, I must be easy.</p>

	<p><b>Just a couple of days of busy stuff</b></p>

<p>It's been a couple of busy days around here.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I attended a pretty decent library conference on marketing reference services (or the reference "experience" as one library director calls it.) </p>

<p>There were a number of good suggestions on how to market reference (along with simply getting people to come in the door.) Other speakers had comments that had me wondering what their point was and why they felt their comments had any applicability to the subject at hand. I guess that's just par for the course.</p>

<p>I've definitely concluded that I need to be more outgoing on the reference desk (if you can imagine that). People just are not seeing us and we need to change that.</p>

<p>Today, I'm trying to fix damage I cause to a website. It amazes me how a website can look great in one browser and break into pieces in another browser. Fortunately, I've finally figured out why it was broken and I think I have the problems solved.</p>

<p>I need to stop in at another client's workplace to see if they have some of the materials I need to finish their project. Then it's a drive to the hilltop to get new license plates and pay van insurance.</p>

<p>Then maybe I'll have time to stop and think about life, the universe and everything.</p>

	<p><b>All's Fair in Love and Euchre</b></p>

<p>Note: If you don't understand euchre, don't even bother :)</p>

<p>Every few weeks we play cards with our friends who own the local movie theatre. The Ratcliff's have two kids with a third on the way. Thus, when they can manage to get a babysitter, it's party night.</p>

<p>Six-handed Euchre is the game of choice or Uno if we can't get six to play. We keep intending to invite others, but never get around to it.</p>

<p>It was an even split on the night, Laura Ratcliff, Josiah and I won the first round. Tony Ratcliff, our friend Caryl and Darlene won the second round on a misdeal. </p>

<p>We were both in the barn and I was halfway through the winning hand when we realized Darlene dealt me an extra card -- it was a sticky deck. A misdeal was called and Josiah dealt Darlene the winning hand and we lost 10-9.</p>

<p>If that was how the whole night went, I'd been pretty growly. However, it really made us even. </p>

<p>In the first game, it was my deal and I lucked out. I got four hearts in my hand with a low heart turned up. I was planning to pick it up, but Darlene called hearts first. How I managed I don't know, but I kept a straight face the whole time and ruined her hand. She thought she won the last card and I slowly tossed down the last heart a second after they started celebrating.</p>

<p>"Five hearts?! Five hearts!? How could I have known you had five hearts?!" Hearing Darlene say that alone was worth a million.</p>

	<p><strong>Boy, do I have a headache</strong></p>

<p>The library is getting into the Halloween spirit-- everyone is wearing deely-boppers which are <a href="http://justdolphins.safeshopper.com/107/1037.htm?529">something to this effect</a> if you have never seen a pair before.</p>

<p>I was a good sport and wore a pair as well. Mine had spiders on them while most everyone else had bats (which were cuter--though that may have been worse news for me). I received plenty of smiles to say the least including one woman who came in and said grimaced. "I won't look, I promise" smiled and of course looked and then covered her eyes. Yes, I looked darned silly.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the things have tines to stick in your hair and I simply don't have enough of that. Thus it stuck in my head. So I put tape on them and that helped a bit, but still after wearing the silly things for a while I ended up with a awful headache.</p>

<p>Then again, tonight's meeting of the Madison Historic District Board of Review may also induce a headache.</p>

<p>Another workweek has started all too quick. At least today we actually have our catalog working. I'll take blessings where I can get them.</p>

<p>Expanded the selection of comics on the comics page, though I can't guarentee their quality or taste at this point. All I know is the titles sounded interesting. They are being "beamed" in from another website by javascript or *tooncasting* as it's called.</p>

<p>Bloop.tv is pretty cool. Very nice animation.</p>

	<p><strong>Company came</strong></p>

<p>Darlene's sister came to town this weekend for the first time in a year.  </p>

<p>We had a fun day of hiking, sampling soups at a new festival in town "Soup, Stew, Chili and Brew" and then had a dinner of a super premium ice creme with a dessert of wonton soup and egg roles. Today we walked along the river and played euchre.</p>

<p>When Janie visits everyone in town automatically knows that's Darlene's sister. They look alike in the face and hair, though Janie is a head taller (the only girl of four in the family with any height).</p>

<p>When I'm wrapped in the finer things of being part of a big family, life feels rich.</p>

	<p><b>Morning has broken</b></p>

<p>After several late hours of preparing for a visit by Darlene's sister, we finally crashed and a woke up feeling as broken as morning.</p>

<p>The morning sun comes in our east facing windows first thing so, because of Darlene's light sensitive eyes, we added a second curtain.</p>

<p>We really don't have a good way of hanging these second curtains so I bought ones with loops and hung a loop on either side of the existing curtain that in turn is on a spring-loaded curtain rod.</p>

<p>As a result, if you can visualize this, the center of the second curtain is hanging loose.</p>

<p>Back to the morning sun. It hits us directly and shines through the area where the second curtain is sagging. On the far wall a "grin" suddenly appears like a Cheshire cat. The crinkled first curtain creating the illusion of teeth on the grin.</p>

<p>After noticing this, we've been able to track the time within a few minutes and the season as it has slowly moved right along the west wall.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the grin is coming later and later. I'm going to hate waking up at 6:30 pretty darn soon.</p>

<p>We're having a "Soup, Stew, Chilli and Brew" festival on Main Street today. We hope to do our sampling before it starts raining this afternoon. Better yet, her sister and her family will let us take them on a hike this morning to get our hunger up for soup, stew, chili and brew.<br />

<p>Boy the leaves are really starting to pop. It's a pitty it'll rain this weekend and knock most of them down. Darlene's sister and her family are coming to visit Saturday so we're aiming to drag them out for a hike at Clifty Fall State Park before the rain hits.</p>

<p>Also note, this website now has a photos page and a comics page! The photos are assorted with no identification at this point--I'm working on that. There's only one or two comics so far, but I'm sure that number will grow as well.</p>

<p>Let me know what you'd like to see on this site and I'll pop it up.</p>

	<p><strong>Made the mistake of opening the mail</strong></p>

<p>Our budget is shot for a while. We just received our property and business tax bills and they came in about twice what we expected. </p>

<p>Indiana restructured its property assessment methods from an archaic "replacement value" system to a modern "market value" system. The change is hitting the historic district hard because old structures used to be valued low due to depreciation. Under the market system, there's higher demand thus a higher value on the property.</p>

<p>We're lucky actually, I believe we were underassessed. Our assessed value climbed only 30 percent. Many properties downtown doubled if not tripled in value. In turn, our taxes climbed from about $930/year to $1250/year. Obviously, that's not bad compared to what some of our friends are facing. </p>

<p>In the process, our tax bills were delayed. In a normal year we'd be able to split this amount in half payable in May and November. Because of the reassessment, the Spring bills never came so now we have to cough up the whole amount in about 30 days.</p>

<p>It's not bad really, it's just that for some stupid reason we were expecting our homestead and mortgage deductions to kick in this year. They don't kick in until *next* year-- thus we owe a *lot* more than we expected.</p>

<p>Now watch a few of my friends write me back asking why I'm complaining about a $1,250 bill when theirs are a lot higher. Hey, what can I say... we were spoiled.</p>

	<p><b>River Bottom Reading</b></p>

<p>I hosted a prose and poetry reading at the library last night. It was a quiet affair where people simply came up to the microphone and read their work for a few minutes. We had a better turnout than I expected so it made for a nice evening. There are some good writers here.</p>

<p>I read a story I've been trying to write for about a dozen years. I wrote it and have been rewriting it ever since. It still isn't what I hoped it could be, but hearing myself read it aloud helped me identify where some of the holes are. Unfortunately, they range in the dozens.</p>

<p>I believe I was a decent journalistic writer, but being a fiction writer is another ball of wax. You need to be able to hear the voices of the characters and you have to create a story and twists someone will spend their time reading. I was lucky. I had to dig for my information, but everyone else gave me the stories and twists. Counting on my own mind to invent the stuff seems impossible in contrast.</p>

	<p><strong>Laundry Night</strong></p>

<p>Last night was laundry night. As much of a pain as it may be to leave the house and go to a laundrymat, it's kind of fun too.</p>

<p>It's a ritual. We quickly load everything into the triple-loaders and go a couple of doors down to the look in the window of the downtown pet store.</p>

<p>There is always a cage of cute kittens. Sometimes they're climbing over each other and pawing at the windows. Last night they were sleeping. Their four sets of eyes were four sets of lines above their pink noses. Two butterscotch tabbies and two calico tabbies.</p>

<p>In the next window were a dozen mice running all over and under each other. Watching four mice on a wheel is a hoot. They're all trying to go in opposite directions and if one stops running they end up doing a couple loops. Then there were the guinea pigs (no thanks, they make me very sick). </p>

<p><strong>What I'm listening to</strong>: New Music Tuesday on <a href="http://www.woxy.com/">WOXY</a> from my old college town. Excellent modern rock. It reminds me of the good stuff from the 80s, but with more edge. Their stream is live on the Internet. I downloaded iTunes for Windows the other day (as earlier noted). I don't have any music on my computer to listen to, but the program does have a list of a few dozen radio stations to listen to.</p>

	<p><strong>Sundays</strong></p>

<p>Sundays at the library can be unpredictable. Sometimes our online catalog works. Sometimes it doesn't. Today it isn't. Once a week they rebuild the database and as a result, it is not showing us any items after 1995.</p>

<p>So far, however, no one has asked us where a book is located. To make life a little easier I have a simple <a href="http://www.tnrdlib.bc.ca/dewey.html">Dewey Decimal Classification</a> chart pulled up. Unfortunately, it doesn't go into a lot of detail. If someone asks about the disease of the week, it doesn't give you much help. Saying "go look in 614 just doesn't cut it."</p>

	<p><b>Tall Stacks</b></p>

<p>Boy is it a beautiful day. The sky is crispy blue and the sun is as warm as a fresh Crispy Creme. </p>

<p>Up in Cincinnati is the <a href="http://www.tallstacks.org">Tall Stacks Festival</a>. More than a dozen riverboats from across the country are there.</p>

<p>Several of the boats putted past en route. The Delta and Mississippi Queens stopped here for several hours on Thursday. Darlene took the photo on top of the page and I had fun with it turning it into a pastel drawing using Photoshop.</p>

<p>The Delta Queen returned today and I helped take a group of two dozen people from the riverboat on a tour of downtown today. It was part of my training to become a walking tour guide next year. They were taking a two day trip from Cincinnati to Madison and back. I didn't get a chance to go on the boat, maybe in future trips. But I did get some nice photos. As I type, the coliape just started playing and the boat paddled past. It's great to see the river from our front door. </p>

<p>There's also a nice crowd of leafers in town and several of them stopped by and bought mugs and tiles. It kept Darlene busy most of the afternoon. Right now we're waiting for the kiln to cool so we can take a load up to the gallery in Columbus, Indiana. That's life on the river's edge.</p>

	<p><strong>No joy in Mudville</strong></p>

<p>It brought the joy of baseball back in my heart. The possibilities were great. The luvable Cubbies versus the Red Sox of my dad's hometown in the World Series. Neither had won in so long, it would have been the best series in history.</p>

<p>But, no the Cubs had to blow three games straight and the Red Sox couldn't hold a 5-2 lead past the eighth inning. So now I get to choose between a team I have always hated or a team I have never cared for. I'm not even going to bother.</p>

<p>So I guess it's on to football. Now if the Buffalo Bills would just win again. They're like my Kansas City Royals, the season started out with such promise before sliding into mediocrity.</p>

	<p><strong>What can I say, it's a Wednesday (I'd rather have a Monday.)</strong></p>

<p>It's a beautiful day and I'm preparing to look at computer screens for the next couple hours. </p>

<p>Nor am I looking forward to tonight. There are a ton of kids books to shelve. I think the fact you can't just shelve a kid's book is what makes it hard- with the easy readers you have to look at five books before you can shelve the one because the ID tags are not on the spine, but on the front of the book.</p>

<p>Maybe I can bribe Darlene to spending an hour or two of her time tonight and at least keeping me company while I'm shelving.</p>

<p>Tonight we'll be showing "North By Northwest" as our free movie. I wish I could skip shelving and watch that instead. Tomorrow we're holding an open house here at the library to premier our long-range plan and also our new online photo collection. That should be fun (if not fun at least there will be good, catered munchies).</p>

<p>We finally decided on a place to put our pots here in Madison. We'll have an open house one or two afternoons a week, but we needed a reliable place to put the pots for the majority of the sales. I think <a href="http://www.shopwhimsy.com/">Whimsy</a> will do a good job with them. We'll probably take them some pots this weekend. </p>

<p>Saturday morning I'm going to learn how to give historic walking tours downtown. Historic Madison, Inc. is going to put me in their stable of tour guides for next year. I'll get paid about $25 for two hours work and get to go on the <a href="http://www.deltaqueen.com/">big riverboats</a> to meet the passengers for the tours. That should be fun.</p>

<p>I'm off to apply "NT Profile Locking Tool" and "Secure NT Registry" to a few of our public computers. I hope it works. They've been getting infected with spyware that highjacks the web browser and sends it off to site that plaster the screen with pop-up ads. Yuch, what a pain.</p>

<p>There is a company that is offering free webspace for three years. The offer expires 1/14/04. <a href="http://www.1and1.com">1and1.com</a>. Let me know if anyone decides to do it so I can get signed up for a free vacation giveaway :) The deal is awesome, but the control panel is slow was molassas last night. </p>

<p>Either way, for $6 I bought the name <a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge ">ontheriversedge.com </a>and will soon move my blog to that address. I'll send out emails when it actually takes effect. I can do a lot more with the site when I'm in my own webspace.</p>

	<p><strong>Fall is here</strong><br />
It is really turning beautiful in this rivertown. The leaves are losing their green, albeit reluctantly. The colors are not brilliant, dull golds and browns. Some red and orange to spice things up. Mind you, I don't think we'l be at peak for another week give or take.</p>

<p>Darlene and I took a nice hike at the Clifty Canyon Nature Preserve, a park of the state park here in town. We have a favorite trail because it goes through mini-canyons and past waterfalls. We usually go the same direction every time, but decided to be contrary and go the opposite way. </p>

<p>It is truly amazing how different the same area looks when you go uphill instead of downhill. There is one stretch of the trail that is literally on the cusp of a 20-foot cliff. We had become used to it and stopped thinking about it. Going the other way it suddenly looked ominous. Just awesome.</p>

<p>Biking to work is great, my wheels crunching in a hum across all the fallen leaves. Our parking lot is just covered, rice crispies from one end to the other.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the beautiful weather won't last. Tomorrow it'll rain and the cool temperatures will return later this week. I think I'll drag Darlene on a walk tonight (not that it will be an effort-she'll probably drag me first).</p>

	<p><strong>Okay, now I'm embarrassed</strong></p>

<p>A few weeks ago, a traveling food writer came to the library and asked a couple of questions about good restaurants here, etc. I'm a ham for talking up this town so I gave her all kinds of information (I suspect to the chagrin of one of the other librarians-I've been warned I spent too much time on answering patron questions).</p>

<p>Either way, I should have refused, but she wanted to take my picture. In my mail box today was a copy of the article. Ouch. I'm glad the weekly newspaper is published on the other side of the state (Michigan City) because I'm not sure I'd want anyone here to see it.</p>

<p>For laughs I have provided the link to the issue. On a slow connection it may take a while to download. Look on page 26 to read the article.</p>

	<p><b>Saturday night</b></p>

<p>A good night's sleep is being elusive this week. I've been falling victim to the post-lunch nap and almost feel worse afterwards. Then in turn I can't get back to sleep that night because I slept too long in the afternoon. grrr. </p>

<p>This weekend I popped six web logs together so two of my clients can update their own webpages without worrying about whether I'm too busy to get the job done. Now I just have to get them trained. Can old dogs learn new tricks? I think this will be easier than trying to teach them how to design websites from scratch which they both originally wanted to do.</p>

<p>Maybe now that they're mostly done I can reduce the stress a little. Of course, they'll need some other kind of updates to keep me busy. I just wish they weren't barter jobs. Mind you I did have some very fresh bagels and cinnamon rolls for breakfast this morning.</p>

<p>I need to start saying no and stop taking on projects. Before I got the library job I wanted to get the projects so bad in order to pay the bills. Now I'm doing them to get cash for my computer junk and to show everyone they should have hired me earlier. Moonlighting to buy goodies is one thing, but I know the later reason has little reason to it. Mind you, when I said yes, I wasn't planning on taking the stupid GRE.</p>

<p>I think it's time to quit for the night and veg to the tune of a MASH episode or two.</p>

	<p><b>Ah the weekend.</b></p>

<p>OK, I survived my Thursday. Got a decent night's sleep and took another nap this afternoon. Darlene is a siren of the afternoon nap...</p>

<p>Now I'm trying to get a website redesigned so the baker can update her weekly specials on her own. I'm hoping designing a set of blogs will do the trick.</p>

<p><b>What I'm reading</b>: "The Sands of Time" by Michael Hoeye. "A Hermux Tantamoq Adventure (TM)." </p>

<p>This is a great children's mystery-adventure series set in a mythical world of mice. Very English and literate for a kids book. </p>

<p>Hermux is a gentle, but brave "everymouse" and watchmaker. His old friend was blind for three year and her sight was saved by Hermux in the previous book (though I don't remember how). She is an artist and her first exhibit having sight restored is of visions she had when she was blind. But HORRORS- the paintings are of... gasp... CATS!!! Nude ones at that. In the mouse world cats were aweful mythical beasts that are *never* spoken of in public. However, Hermux ends up in an adventure that aims to prove them all wrong.</p>

<p>Read the first book "Time Stops for No Mouse" first. These are a great workday reads as the chapters are each only 2-3 pages long. As I get a task done, I've been allowing myself to read a chapter. I couldn't get away with that at work, but hey when I moonlight I do it right.</p>

	<h3>zzzzzz</h3>
	
	<p><strong>zzzzzz</strong></p>

<p>I'm doing everything I can to avoid falling asleep at the reference desk this afternoon. Just didn't sleep well at all last night. </p>

<p>Part of the problem is Darlene and I fell into a bad habit of eating in bed. Last winter was cold and the covers kept us warm. Now it is indeed a habit and the crumbs end up everywhere. We'll brush off the sheets, but you can guarentee there will be crumbs in the covers. Thus, whenever we flip, more crumbs end up in the bed.</p>

<p>Also the bed is seeing the end of its usefulness. Since the Madison Chautauqua was good to us, we have money. We decided to work on plumbing instead of buying a new mattress set.  However, after a night of flipping like pancakes, we're questioning our decision.</p>

<p>Of course, once I woke up my mind (partially delirious having not eaten for 8 hours) wouldn't shut down. My mind kept trying figure a way to balance my moonlighting with prepping for the GRE. I need to relearn a bunch of math, but I also need to get some website coding done. There just isn't time for both. Meanwhile, the back half of my mind was praying for an old friend who yesterday bid farewell.</p>

<p>There's hardly anyone in the library this afternoon (where are they?) so I've already gotten a lot of work done. I just wish someone would ask me a reference question so I can stay awake.</p>

	<h3>Another design project?</h3>
	
	<p><strong>Another design project? *arrgghhh*</strong></p>

<p>Received an interesting phone call at work today. The director of the local convention and visitors bureau called to ask if I'd be interested in submitting a bid to do the new visitors website. It's a nice ego boost that my work would even be considered. </p>

<p>Right now I'm stuggling trying to figure out how to pull everything off to begin with. I have about six projects on the burners already and I'm trying to put a number of them to bed so I can concentrate on looking into grad school. Ideally, I'd take the GRE next month, but I just don't know if I can get enough studying in. Part of me is tempted to put it off a semester to give me more time, but then I don't know if the scholarships would be as available as they are in the fall.</p>

<p>Even if I don't do the site, the director welcomed my input on the decision process and that is good because their <a href="http://www.visitmadison.org/">website</a> needs a big improvement. I don't want to do it as much as I want it to look the way it should-- a graphical site that makes people drool at the thought of coming to Madison.</p>

	<h3>Oof, I need a bike</h3>
	
	<p><b>Oof, I need a bike ride</b><br />
It's truly amazing how fast a body can fall apart. I have not gone on my daily bike ride since Friday and boy am I feeling it. Everything's gone stiff and sore. I need to get back to it tomorrow.</p>

<p>This sudden chilly weather doesn't help either. At night we're huddled under a pile of blankets and don't want to get up in the morning. I think it's time to quit pretending this is a cabin and plug in our heater tonight.</p>

<p>Darlene and I are also trying to figure out a way of getting each other out of our little worlds. I'm wrapped up at the library and she in her pots. We went swimming all the time during the summer and miss it terribly-it was our exercise, talking and socializing time and we haven't had that since mid-August. This vacation is starting to help, but we're trying to find a way of not having that "together time" end suddenly.</p>

<p>I need to put the chicken on the grill. One of those cheap $13 George Foreman grills was the best buy we've made in a long time--meat tastes great out of that little thing.</p>

<p>The days after a big show are always a struggle. Darlene and I have napped several hours in the past two days. Maybe tomorrow will feel normal. Maybe tomorrow we'll get something accomplished (I don't count paying bills as accomplishing anything ;)</p>

<p>The photo I popped up on top is one of the many barges I see floating by daily. I kind of wish they actually stopped here. On occasion, they send a row boat to shore to grab some supplies, but that's about it. The river industry that made this town thrive is just gone.</p>

	<h3>Chautauqua Report, Day 2</h3>
	
	<p><b>Chautauqua Report, Day 2</b></p>

<p>*Whew* Finally. </p>

<p>We have not had a decent sales at an arts festival since 9/11/01. This was the first.</p>

<p>Saturday was OK, but Sunday was better--surprisingly so as the crowds were way down from the opening day.</p>

<p>Darlene sold another <i>three</i> sculptures Sunday including one to a couple where the better (or worse) half wants to buy another sculpture as a surprise Christmas gift.</p>

<p>It might have been even better had a storm not shown up at 3:30 p.m. </p>

<p>About two minutes before the clouds let loose, I walked into the street in front of our booth and saw a curtain of rain coming up the valley. My jaw dropped, I have never seen rain come right at me like that.</p>

<p>Everyone was yelling warnings about the rain. Customers were running down the street then, also seeing the rain, turned tail and ran the other way.</p>

<p>Fortunately, a few friends showed up at that exact moment and helped us lay the pots into boxes so winds wouldn't blow them down.</p>

<p>It hit, but fortunately, the storm wasn't as bad as it looked.</p>

<p>Today we're depositing the money and quickly divying the proceeds among the various utility companies (as long as we don't confuse our Verizon and Vectren bills we'll be in good shape).</p>

<p>Then we get to unpack all the pots and try to set up our studio display again.</p>

	<h3>Chautauqua report, day one</h3>
	
	<p><b>Chautauqua report, day one</b></p>

<p>After being worried about getting rained out all day Saturday, we woke up in the morning to happily find it had blown through overnight.</p>

<p>The afternoon was sunny, warm and breezy. The wind pushing diamond tipped waves up river.</p>

<p>Our new booth space on the riverfront may not be as good sales-wise as our old locations, but it is definitely more picturesque. </p>

<p>We spent the day watching the river and the Kentucky shoreline. Boats from up and down river pulled ashore. A few barges loaded with coal and some sort of gaseous cargo plowed upriver, the wake rocking everything.</p>

<p>The trees in the valley and climbing up the Kentucky bluffs were golden-tipped, but not yet ready to give up its green to autumn.</p>

<p>Behind us was the <a href="http://www.laniermansion.org">Lanier Mansion</a> in butterscotch and merrangue coloring with it's very nice gardens and greens. We sat on the 160-year-old stone fence that surrounded the grounds.</p>

<p>Sales were better than last month. People weren't as hesitant to buy the big pieces, Darlene sold a sculpture and several large bowls. However, we won't know if overall sales are holding up until after today.</p>

<p>We got another load out of the kiln and are packing to head out.</p>

	<h3>Madison Chautauqua Festival of Art</h3>
	
	<p><a href="http://www.madisonchautauqua.com/">Madison Chautauqua Festival of Art</a></p>

<p>The website's not that great, but the weekend is. More than 200 artists attract 50,000 to 70,000 people to town over the weekend. </p>

<p>The show doesn't start until tomorrow, but already the streets are filling up. I hesitate to move the van until I absolutely have to for fear of losing the space until Sunday night. </p>

<p>Every morning, I roll my bike out the front door on my way to work and whip around the corner as I mount. Since I bought my bike in mid-July, I have never seen anyone as I round the corner. This morning of course I nearly hit an elderly couple. CRINGE. I need to remember these things.</p>

<p>In general, the show is really nice and features good art. However, compared to a few years ago, the quality of work is going down. It used to be gallery quality, but they have let in more country crafts. Not bad stuff, just not the stuff that will attract the upper-end clientel our town could thrive off of.</p>

<p>Sometimes I just don't think the people who live here "get it" and see what a gem this place is. They're still in the mode of cheap antique shoppers. We can attract a lot better clientel than that. Indeed, we need to in order to keep the businesses on Main Street healthy in the long run. </p>

<p>It's hurting right now because tourism is down and the money to market tourism comes from tourism (hotel taxes) so the situation could just get worse.</p>

<p>The flip of this equation is that people from Chicago, Key West and LA are discovering us and buying up property. We're not paying attention to this trend either. We need to insure a means of keeping affordable housing, espcially in the downtown historic district.</p>

<p>It's all a balance. </p>

<p>One woman from Bloomington bought a small little brick house. More cottage than house really. She calls it her "menopause home." She paid more than $70,000 for it. For as small as the place was, that seems really high to me. Mind you the location was awesome, just across from the <a href="http://www.laniermansion.org/">Lanier Mansion</a>, and the condition was decent.</p>

<p>I guess the kicker is that I make "Madison" wages and can't afford it. She make "Bloomington" wages and can. Expensive here is cheap elsewhere. </p>

<p>Again, it's all a balance.</p>

<p>OK, I'm off my soapbox for the afternoon.</p>

	<p>Wow! We had a lot of fun at our inaugural River Bottom Reading.</p>

<p>We had about 15 poets perform their work for a nice sized audience that ranged from 12 to the mid-70s. We had a few high schoolers, a couple college students, a few older poets. Our emcee had been to two National Poetry Slams, a Brazilian woman who is now writing poetry in two languages and a Native American woman who is writing poetry based on writing and experiences of her elders. All in all really good stuff.</p>

<p>Either way, the grand champion of our inaugural slam was Richard Zehe. Congratulations.</p>

<p>My hope is to eventually have an open microphone reading once a month with a slam being held every third month (once a season essentially).</p>

<h4>what.</h4>
<ul><li>This is a journal of our life, culture, libraries, the Apple Macintosh, progressive politics, and of course historic Madison, Indiana, the most beautiful rivertown in America.</li></ul>

<h4>who.</h4> 

<ul><li>G'day, I'm E.G. Yarnetsky and I answer questions at our local library. I'm preparing to go to grad school in January. I'm a former journalist who still dabbles in design work. My wife's a potter who makes beautiful functional and sculptural ceramics.</li></ul>
