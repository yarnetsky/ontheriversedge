	<h3>Trying to shift the news cycle</h3>
	
	<p>The news for the past few weeks was that Bush planned to take some time and ponder his choice for Supreme Court ... then suddenly poof! Out comes a nomination out of the hat. (<a title="Bush Chooses Judge Roberts for Supreme Court - New York Times" href="http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/politics/politics-bush-court.html">Bush Chooses Judge Roberts for Supreme Court - New York Times</a>)</p>

<p>Can you say "Bush is desperate to change the news away from Rove?"<br />

	<h3>Bush "shifting" on Plame blame? Try "shafting"...</h3>
	
	<p>OK now, on June 10, 2004, President Bush was asked if he would fire anyone who had anything to do with the leaking Valerie Plame-Wilson's name as a covert CIA agent. Bush responded "yes" and his spokeman since repeated the statement to the White House press corps.</p>

<p>How come today, he is suddenly "shifting" his position as USA Today put it?<br />
Now  he'll <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-07-18-bush-rove_x.htm">"if someone committed a <b><i>crime</i></b>, they will no longer work in my administration."</a></p>

<p>To me that essentially says he <b><i>knows</i></b> someone (or someones) in his administration most definitely messed with Plame, but he doesn't want to do a damn thing about it.</p>

<p>Striking out at Plame because her husband discredited the Bush rally cry to war would be playground petty if she were not with the CIA. However, she was an agent and to me that borders on treason.</p>

<p>Why? Consider this question... if Plame is outted as a covert agent, isn't that in turn going to out anyone who covertly worked with her?</p>

<p>This isn't the only thing about his statement today that drives me bats-- how about the notion that he's known about the allegation for two years and says he "doesn't know all the facts." For that to be true he must have told everyone involved to keep him in the dark so he wouldn't have to testify.</p>

<p>If there's any saving grace its that the White House press corps finally has a string to pull. They suddenly seem to realize they've been lied to and are trying to unravel the mess we're in. Mind you, the odds of that happening are still pretty slim, but you can't blame a cat for dreaming.</p>

	<h3>Lost Civil Liberties</h3>
	
	<p>My mom visited us just before the holiday and brought us an Alice in Wonderland mug that had a disappearing Cheshire cat when you put in hot water. The mug is great (it doesn't hurt that I love the Sir John Tenniel's illustrations). </p>

<p>Today I stumbled upon another product from the Unemployed Philosphers Guild: the <a title="Unemployed Philosophers Guild: Lost Civil Liberties mug" href="http://www.philosophersguild.com/index.lasso?page_mode=Product_Detail&item=0236">Lost Civil Liberties mug</a>.</p>

	<h3>Help save NPR and PBS</h3>
	
	<p>If you like public television or public radio, now is the time to act as the House of Representatives is planning to slash the budget. <a href="www.moveon.org">MoveOn.org</a> is rallying to protect PBS and NPR from budget cuts through a petition on which they hope to get 1 million signatures.</p>

<p>When I was attending college at Miami University, I worked in the news department of the public radio station WMUB. The experience was by far the best journalism experience I ever had. When I found a story, they gave me the air time to tell it right. You just can't find that anywhere else on the radio dial. </p>

<p>Why do I favor public funding for NPR? Radio media today is highly consolidated supported by and subservient to its advertisers. There are certainly a number of really good stations that don't let ad dollars interfere with its reporting, but if you want news that serves you public radio is the place to get it. </p>

<p>PBS speaks for itself as the number of kids who have learned courtesies and their letters and numbers from Seseme St. is incalculable. Schools across the nation use PBS programming in their lesson plans.</p>

<p>The bottom line is this is valuable to me. I believe it makes our communities stronger. I encourage you to sign this <a href="http://www.moveon.org">petition</a>. It should be the top link on the page.</p>

<p><b>Sidenote</b>: These kinds of cuts were considered in 1995 and a similar petition was circulated. However, once the threat subsided, the petition continued to circulate and it was soon labeled as a hoax. However, this is real and the vote will take place in the next few days. That's why I'm linking only to the homepage of Moveon.org. If the petition is not the top link on the page, it's too late for this round.<br />

		<h2>06.10.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Dean's truthtelling not settling well with Demo insiders</h3>
	
	<p>Here's a recent quote from Howard Dean...<br />
<blockquote><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2005/06/07/MNdean07.TMP">(Dean) said in San Francisco this week</a> that Republicans are "a pretty monolithic party. They all behave the same. They all look the same. It's pretty much a white Christian party."</p>

<p>"The Republicans are not very friendly to different kinds of people," Dean said Monday, responding to a question about diversity during a forum with minority leaders and journalists. "We're more welcoming to different folks, because that's the type of people we are. But that's not enough. We do have to deliver on things: jobs and housing and business opportunities."<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>In the past couple of days a number of Democratic elected officials and leaders have growled at Dean for the statement. In part because all that is being reported is that Dean said Republicans "are pretty much a white Christian party."</p>

<p>If Dean made a mistake here it was possibly leaving out the word "leadership" after Republican, because that's who he's talking about. </p>

<p>Consider this. "Of the 3,643 Republicans serving in the state legislatures, <a href="http://americablog.blogspot.com/2005/06/oops-gop-really-is-all-white-study.html">only 44 are minorities</a>, or 1.2 percent." White? Yes. Is the Christian right driving the Republican social policy? Yes.</p>

<p>The truth is that the GOP is run by the Christian right on social issues and by corporate libertarians on economic issues. These people don't want a "voice" in a democrary. They don't even want to be the majority in a democracy. They want to rule-- lock, stock and barrel.</p>

<p>I give Dean tons of credit for trying to tell people we are heading toward a plutocratic theocracy-- one that is oddly unChrist-like.</p>

<p>Yet, we are in a time where this political truth telling can get your head chopped off by the GOP machine and the Democratic leadership is still clearly afraid of this buzz saw. If we can't find a way of telling America the political truth of what we face, how can we possibly win in 2006 or ever?</p>

<p>So to the Democratic leaders who are chewing on Dean I have this to say... if you don't like hearing Dean tell the truth, you better figure a better way of doing it yourself.</p>

<p><b>Afterword</b>: I did read an article that the D.C. Democratic gang is angry because Dean is ignoring the Democratic corporate fatcats when it comes to fundraising. </p>

<p>Dean is actually doing an awesome job of raising money-- we're nearly doubling our off-year fundraising records (though Republicans are still outraising us 2:1). However, most of this money is being raised through small donations and, to make it worse (to insiders eyes), the money is being given to state parties. </p>

<p>This is actually genius because it is at the state level that the Democrats are having the most luck and that can only ripple into the national ranks. Yet, the Washington establishment appears to be flinching at the notion and a few people are wondering if this isn't a reason the establishment wants to take out Dean.</p>

	<h3>Welcome to the police state?</h3>
	
	<p>This is ugly.. really ugly. (But stay tuned to the end, because I'll toss in a cute aside to make up for the pain)...</p>

<p>The American Civil Liberties Union is reporting that the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is planning to vote on a greatly expanded Patriot Act. The kicker, they're allegedly going to do this in a closed secret meeting. </p>

<p>That alone is anti-democracy, but it's no wonder they are doing it behind closed doors-- the bill is outright scary. Here's the part that gauls me as a future librarian...<br />
<blockquote>The bill would grant so-called "administrative subpoena" authority to the FBI, letting the bureau write and approve its own search orders for any tangible thing it deems relevant to an intelligence investigation without approval. This power would let agents seize personal records from medical facilities, libraries, hotels, gun dealers, banks and any other business, without having to appear before a judge, and without any evidence that the people whose records are swept in are involved in any criminal activity.</blockquote></p>

<p>Without any checks whatsoever, we might as well rename the FBI the KGB.</p>

<p>Here are some ACLU links:<br />

<p><b>Now for the cute that I promised</b>... We have workgroups in my library management class and my teammate Elsa sent me a link for <a href="http://www.storewars.org">Store Wars</a>. It's a very smart and timely parody of the original Star Wars comparing organic foods to your usual grocery aisle goods. It's cute as a cucumber...</p>

	<h3>filibuster deal: could be better, could be worse</h3>
	
	<p>In the days prior to homework I'd have known about the filibuster deal immediately. Instead I learned about it nearly four hours later... I'm slipping.</p>

<p>In the world that the Senate should be and has been practiced for umpteen decades, there wouldn't be a question about the filibuster. Both parties have used it to keep the wingers out of posts. The filibuster is honorable and a sound way of protecting the minority voice in the Senate. A filibuster allows for individuals in the august body to have their say, yet also puts their entire party on the line. </p>

<p>If the Repugs wanted to pick on rules to change-- it should be the committee chairman that won't even bring a nomination before their committtee. The difference is one person blocking a process versus 40+ senators blocking a process.</p>

<p>The Democrats should not have had to make a compromise on such a basic tradition. Yet, when you're down by 10 votes and the right wingers are hellbent for domination you do what you can do to survive until the next election and hope that one's not fixed.</p>

<p>Still, what president has EVER had 95 percent of their appointees approved? What president or party has EVER had the gaul to assume they'd get 100 percent approval?</p>

		<h2>05.16.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>A new morality for the 21st century?</h3>
	
	<p>For my library management class I'm reading an interesting book called "Civic Librarianship" by Ronald B. McCabe. </p>

<p>McCabe argues that the libertarian trends of the 60s-mid 90s created a nation where communities and civic institutions have been reduced to business models with no moral authority to help society. Libraries, schools and newspapers, for examples, are no longer educators and protectors of our civic society, but simple purveyors of information.</p>

<p>This in turn causes management and the public to devalue the civic professionals such as teachers, librarians and journalists. The library world is screaming at these trends--Philadelphia, for example, has been planning to reduce numerous branches to "express libraries" staffed only with paraprofessionals. The reasoning? Who needs professional librarians in a world where libraries are becoming nothing more than glorified bookstores?</p>

<p>McCabe argues this trend started in the 1960s when counter-culture rebeled against the "moral" authority of authority. In the 1980s, the right joined in on the fun and tossed in an economic libertariansim that not only eliminated much of the moral checks and balances of business, but in turn forced civic institutions to follow business-oriented models of operation.</p>

<p>I'm just under half way through the book so I haven't read too many of his "solutions," but it revolves around the notion that society needs to regain it's shared "morality" that emphasizes a balance between rights and responsiblities-- both socially and economic.</p>

<p>I admit that when it comes to talk of "morality," my fears ask the question "whose morality?" Nonetheless, I think he is correct.</p>

<p>He uses another author's analogy of society as a mosiac. The pieces are all individual and that individuality is not lost. However, there is a frame and a glue that keep the pieces together and creates something bigger than the pieces. The glue is "shared" morality and the frame is community. </p>

<p>This all makes good sense, but the key is obviously the word "shared." While there are indeed morals the supermajority of the public could agree on, we are now in a climate where some of the shards would rather cut us than become a part of the mosiac.</p>

<p>I'll follow up when I read more of the book. I'm curious how the "community movement" could equal a new "civic librarianship."</p>

	<h3>The coming oil crash?</h3>
	
	<p>I take every "doomsday scenarios" with a certain amount of caution as it is hard to sift out good science from junk science. It is harder today with interest groups purposefully introducing junk science or junk reasoning to undermine the real thing.</p>

<p>That said, for some strange reason, I'm suddenly running into a slew of articles about "peak oil" and  the impact to society when we run out of cheap oil. Here's one from <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/_/id/7203633">Rolling Stone</a> magazine I read last night.</p>

<p>Essentially, so many of our "necessities" rely on cheap oil that when it is no longer affordable civilization as we know it will start a slow but definite crash.</p>

<p>Necessities? Obviously our transportation system, but also a slew of industries we consider mandatory from plastics and pharmaceuticals to nearly our entire agricultural system. Without cheap oil all of this will be impacted.</p>

<p>The problem is how do you extrapolate the future? Is it inevitable? Could forward thinking slow or reverse the decline?</p>

<p>I'm obviously not sure, but one thing does seem certain, things will change and we're not talking about it.l</p>

	<h3>Overtime and bankruptcy bills defy family values</h3>
	
	<p>You gotta give Republicans credit. They are taking full advantage of their majority status to pass legislation to their liking. Yet, the vindictiveness of these bills blows me away.</p>

<p>With two recent bills, the Republicans prove themselves the party of the corporations.</p>

<p><b>Bill one</b>: Sen. Rick Santorum is sponsoring a bill that will make overtime applicable to people working more than 80 hours in two weeks. If it passes, an employer could jack you around at will. 50 hours one week, 30 the next, 60 the following and 20 after that.</p>

<p>How is a family to figure out child care then? How will they ever attend a student play or parent-teacher conference?</p>

<p>Even if the 40-hour work week survives, overtime is over.</p>

<p><b>Bill two</b>: The second, more evil bill, will restructure bankruptcy for individuals. In essence they are eliminating the humane elements of bankruptcy law. If you drown in medical bills from an emergency hospitalization? Tough luck, live with the debt. If you are a soldier who goes to Iraq and your salary goes from $60T to $24T and your family falls into bankruptcy? Tough luck, live with it.</p>

<p>This is not "family values" folks. This is paying off the people who put the Republicans in charge.</p>

<p>Review history from 1870 to 1920 (give or take a few years). Corporations basically ruled the country unimpeded and humans were treated like pieces of a machine to be discarded when the parts broke. This may "sound" like a socialist manifesto, but it's not. It was just reality. The industrial revolution was literally built on the backs of the poor and immigrants. </p>

<p>Here are some photos from the era: <a href="http://www.historyplace.com/unitedstates/childlabor/index.html">History Place: Child Labor in America.</a></p>

<p>I doubt we'll ever return to the era of child labor, but it certainly gives you an idea of what I'm trying to say.</p>

<p>Once again, I encourage you to write to your congressmen and senators.</p>

<p>Here are a few links that explain the bills: </p>

	<h3>cheers and jeers</h3>
	
	<p>My wife is addicted to her daily dose of <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/user/Bill%20in%20Portland%20Maine">Cheers and Jeers</a> at Dailykos.com.</p>

<p>"Bill in Portland Maine" does a fine job of bringing a smile to my darlin's face. However, sometimes it's the comments that follow that get her rolling on the floor. Here is one comment that did the trick today... it seems so aprapo being a former journalist....</p>

<blockquote>This test only has one question, but it's a very important one.  Please don't answer it without giving it some serious thought. By giving an honest answer you will discover where you  stand morally. The test features an unlikely, completely fictional situation, in which you will have to make a decision.

<p>You're in Florida...In Miami, to be exact... There is chaos around you, caused by a  hurricane and severe floods. This is a flood of major proportions. You are a photojournalist  working for a major newspaper caught in the middle of this great disaster. The situation is  nearly hopeless.</p>

<p> You're trying to shoot  career-making photos. There are houses and people swirling around you, some disappearing under  the water. Nature is  showing all its' destructive fury. You see a man in the water. He is fighting for his life, trying not to be taken away with the water and debris. You move closer.</p>

<p>Somehow the man looks familiar. Suddenly, you know who it is... it's George W. Bush! At the same time you notice  that the raging waters are about to take him  under, forever. You have two options. You can save him or you can take the  most dramatic photos of your life. You can save the life of George W.  Bush, or you can shoot a Pulitzer Prize-winning photo, documenting the death of one of the world's most powerful men.</p>

<p> Now, here's the  question (and please give an honest answer):</p>

<p> Would you select color film, or rather go with the classic simplicity of black and  white?</blockquote></p>

<p>Darlene was reading me this one out loud and I was about to say save him because I didn't want Cheney as president. Of course, that was before Darlene told me the punchline.</p>

<p>I remember one time saying I hated Bush. He was lying through his teeth about one thing or another and I was mad as a hornet. But I'm getting better about that kind of thing. I'm studying to be a librarian and it is basically in our ethics that we'll serve anyone. I'd even help Karl Rove research whether Hillary Clinton is really an alien from a planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse.</p>

<p>Actually it was from today's Cheers and Jeers that Bill in Portland stated my thoughts about Bush well:</p>

<blockquote>"I don't really hate George W. Bush.  I just think the President of the United States ought to be able to pass a 5th-grade social studies test.  And not break everything he touches.  And not throw the tax dollars I give him down a sinkhole of debt.  And not toss me and my partner into the snapping jaws of the Bible-thumpers.  And not hire media whores.  And not require loyalty oaths.  And not lie.  And not lie.  And not lie..."

<p>---Bill in Portland Maine.</blockquote></p>

<p>I personally don't blame Bill and his partner Michael for being fearful of "Bible-thumpers." Our society has become rather less respectful of fellow human beings. I truly do not believe Jesus would treat gays as lepers, especially considering how well he treated lepers to begin with. Fortunately, most people I know don't thump their Bibles, but rather read the Good Book with care.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Darlene found another tidbit in today's Cheers and Jeers.</p>

<blockquote>CHEERS To HATE, as in "I hate that m* f* George W. Bush and all that he stands for, and I hate his entire administration, and all of his supporters, and all of his apologists.  And oh yeah, I also hate the Republican party. Because I know what they are all about: stealing from the poor to give to the rich, and bigotry and hypocrisy and lies lies lies."

<p>JEERS To HATE, as in "I hate people of different races, creeds, classes and orientations.  Because I never bothered to find out what they are all about and since they are different than me, they must be evil."</p>

<p>There are two different flavors of hate: blind and justified.  </p>

<p>by Billy Shears on Wed Feb 16th, 2005 at 10:06:03 PST</blockquote></p>

<p>Interesting. </p>

<p>If you're curious, the <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/2/16/105234/586">whole thread</a> on hate started when a columnist called Dailykos something akin to a seething pot of hate toward Bush and Republicans.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that Dailykos does not believe in censors. It's not raunchy, but the "f" word flies around.</p>

	<h3>Just when you think you've seen it all</h3>
	
	<p>Haven't you always wondered what the Bush administration was blacking out in the 9-11 Commission Reports? Things they claimed had to stay secret for "national security"? The reasons they held the reports until after the election?</p>

<p>Check out the Dailykos's take on the matter of the <a title="Daily Kos :: FAA Daily Intelligence Reports Identified al-Qaeda Threat" href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/2/11/17138/2221">FAA daily intelligence reports identifying al-Qaeda Threat</a>.</p>

<p>Daily Kos is indeed becoming a very interesting place. Not all blogging is journalism (mine certainly is not), but there's crew of diarists at dkos creating what could be considered open source-investigative journalism. The latest example is the "outting" of a "journalist" all but hired by the White House to protect the president's butt in press conferences? <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/2/10/224122/709">Read all about it</a>.</p>

	<h3>Paying for the coronation</h3>
	
	<p>The more I read about it, the more the Bush coronation on Jan. 20 just gauls me. The fact $40 million dollars was spent on it is amazing -- that's a heck of a lot of political favors being bought. </p>

<p>Yet on the front pages of global newspapers, this extravagance contrasted poorly to photo of a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/picture_gallery/05/middle_east_shooting_in_tal_afar/html/3.stm">little Iraqi girl</a> splattered in her parents blood after her parents were killed by Americans at a check point. Is this a way to win hearts and minds? "Partying American's kill little girls parents?" Here's a <a href="http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/fwis/">Catholic nun's</a> take on the story.</p>

<p>[Mind you, from what I've heard so far the soldiers were in a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. When you have a vehicle that won't stop for a checkpoint, even after warning shots, what do you do? Even shooting at the tires could give a driver time to explode the vehicle. Yet, more of this hell is sure to come. Proof in point? Hundreds of Iraqi police uniforms were stolen in Basra. Would you stop for anyone not knowing who the good guys were?]</p>

<p>Then I read that the local governments are being <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A33804-2005Jan24.html">forced to pay</a> $12 million for the inauguration's extraordinary security. How are the locals supposed to pay for this unfunded federal mandate? The government is saying the locals should use money granted to them for homeland security. Money already earmarked for projects to make us safer. Hearing this do you think residents of Fairfax Co., Va., or Prince George's Co., Md., are feeling safer now?</p>

<p>Yes, it's arguable that Bush deserved to party, but couldn't he have done it in a way that projects just a bit of compassion or maybe in a way that kept these homeland security fund going to projects that actually make those residents safer? Nah, that's not their style.</p>

		<h2>01.13.05</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Action time to save Social Security</h3>
	
	<p>OK folks, it's time to act. I believe we need to preserve Social Security. It is inherently sound and can be rejuvenated with a few sensible adjustments.</p>

<p>The "death" of Social Security is just another lie from the Bush administration not unlike the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq (please note: <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/01/13/news/arms.html">they quit looking for them</a>).</p>

<p>Here's what you can do. Send your congressman and Senators an email or letter. Heck, even if you are in favor of this scheme, write a letter, it's a good exercise in flexing your power as a citizen and I highly encourage it.</p>

<p>I did it through MoveOn.org (<a href="http://www.moveon.org/socialsecurity/">here</a>), however you can also easily look up your Senators' (<a href="http://www.senate.gov/">here</a>) or Rep's (<a href="http://www.house.gov/">here</a>) email addresses.</p>

<p>Go to the extended version to see some basic background information on the topic from MoveOn.org. Also, I copied what I wrote.</p>

<p>I'll tell you what. <b>I have 10 Google email accounts I can give away.</b> The first 10 people who carbon copy me what they wrote to their reps (for or against) will get the still non-public Google email accounts. The kicker is I want them signed (name, city and email) and I will publish them here online. I won't publish the email addresses (that's how you get the accounts).</p>
	
	<p>Here's some quick info from MoveOn.org that I found after I wrote my letter.</p>

<blockquote>
George Bush and Republican leaders have made phasing out Social Security through privatization and massive benefit cuts their top priority for 2005. Members of Congress are choosing sides over the next couple of weeks.

<p>We need to make sure they choose correctly now�before a massive election-style campaign by George Bush and the Wall Street interests gets to them including what might be a $100 million TV ad campaign.</p>

<p>MoveOn�s trying to gather 200,000 signatures to present to lawmakers when they return after the inauguration. You can sign the petition now at:</p>

<p>http://www.moveon.org/socialsecurity/</p>

<p>Social Security is a complicated issue, but the basics are really pretty simple:</p>

<p>� Social Security provides monthly benefits to some 44 million Americans who are retired, disabled or the survivor of a deceased parent. It provides most of the income for older Americans--some 64 percent of their support. It has lifted generations of seniors out of poverty.</p>

<p>� Social Security is not in crisis. That is an outright lie perpetrated in order to create the urgency for radical changes. Under conservative forecasts, the long-term challenges in Social Security do not manifest themselves until 2042. Even then Social Security has 70 percent of needed funds. That shortfall is smaller than the amount needed in 1983, the last time we overhauled Social Security. George Bush's Social Security crisis-talk is an effort to create a specter of doom -- just like the weapons of mass destruction claim in Iraq.</p>

<p>� Phasing out Social Security and replacing it with privatized accounts means one thing: massive cuts in monthly benefits for everybody. Social Security privatization requires diverting taxes used to pay current benefits into privatized accounts invested in risky stocks. Without that money Social Security benefits will inevitably be cut -- some proposals even cut benefits of current retirees. These benefit cuts are inevitable, since diverting Social Security money into privatized accounts means less money to pay current and future benefits.</p>

<p>� Every serious privatization proposal raises the Social Security retirement age to 70. That might be fine if you're a Washington special interest lobbyist but it is incredibly unfair to blue-collar Americans with tough, physical jobs, or for African Americans and Latinos with lower life expectancies.</p>

<p>� Privatization means gambling with your retirement security. There is probably an appropriate place for a little stock market risk in retirement planning -- but it isn't Social Security. Privatization exposes your entire retirement portfolio to stock market risks -- and the risk that you'll outlive any of your savings at retirement. You can't outlive your Social Security benefit.</p>

<p>� So who does benefit? Wall Street. Giant financial services firms have been salivating for decades over the prospect of taking over Social Security. Wall Street would make billions of dollars in profit by managing the privatized accounts -- money that would come directly from your benefits.</p>

<p>� Action is urgently needed today. President Bush and Republican leaders in Congress are joining forces with the financial services industry for a major campaign to convince the public there is a major crisis and pressure members of Congress to vote for privatization. Action is needed now before it is too late. Please sign MoveOn�s petition to protect Social Security at the link below.</p>

<p>http://www.moveon.org/socialsecurity/</p>

<p>Thanks for doing this.</blockquote></p>

<p><br />
Finally, here is what I wrote on the issue...</p>

<blockquote>Dear Sirs,

<p>Please do not scrap Social Security in exchange for private of individual accounts. I am a 38-year-old going to grad school to become a librarian-- I have 401ks, thus I am not among those inherently scared of the stock market.</p>

<p>However, I have several reasons to believe this action should not take place.</p>

<p>1--Privatization may allow for greater growth of deposited funds. However, the stock market is not "secure." The point of Social Security is to help seniors avoid poverty and the welfare rolls. The point is specifically to insure a snippet of "security" for their retirement. Prior to the induction of Social Security, elderly poverty was indeed very high.</p>

<p>2--In my profession, there is a generation of older librarians who were planning on retiring in the past five years. The market bubble burst and they are still out of luck. I know of people (librarians and others) who are having to wait years before they will again be in the position to retire. I personally know of a couple others who needed to retire for health reasons, but because their 401k tanked they had to continue working parttime in order to afford medicines, etc.</p>

<p>3--Finally, history has shown these schemes have been disasterous or near disasterous in other countries. Argentina and United Kingdom come to mind. The UK under Thatcher passed measures very similar to those being mentioned as possible under this plan. The Brits are now publically saying the plan was a failure and that they are now wishing they had a system like our current Social Security. When Argentina went belly up, it was in part due to a similar privatization scheme driving them deep into debt.</p>

<p>4--I do not like being white washed with proganda from our government. Recent memos from the White House have made it clear they are purposefully distorting the issue as a means of undermining the nation's trust in the institution. So explain this, how can the White House say the system is doomed when the Congressional Budget Office research shows Social Security is inherently sound and can be extended decades with no reduction in benefits with sensible adjustments. </p>

<p>--Finally, we are supposedly doing this for our youngest generations-- for myself (I'm among the oldest Gen Xers) and those who follow me. Yet, the federal decifit and debt already out of hand. To pull this off, the nation would have to borrow billions more. Who will pay for it? We will and our children will. This is nothing more than a baby tax. </p>

<p>Good sirs, we are only as good as the world we leave our children. I would rather pay a few more dollars today in taxes and spare the next umpteen generations having to pay for our mistakes.</p>

<p>sincerely,<br />
E.G. Yarnetsky</blockquote></p>

	<h3>Challenge the Ohio vote</h3>
	
	<p>I hope at least one senator has the courage to join with U.S. Rep. John Conyers and challenges the electoral vote in Ohio tomorrow. It would not overthrow the election but it <i>would</i> force Congress to debate what happened in Ohio. </p>

<p>For better or worse, I believe Bush received the votes to win Ohio. However the methods used to depress minority voting in Ohio were technically illegal at best and outright fraudulant at worst. I strongly believe these violations need to be debated at the highest levels with true reforms put into place.</p>

<p>There are plenty of oddities in the Ohio vote -- as well as plenty of unsubstantiated conspiracy theories. However, I believe this much is clear-- there is absolutely no excuse for rich, white, suburban precincts to get a boat load of voting machines while poor, minority, urban districts are given few machines, especially when machines were kept back in storage to boot. Vote suppression is the only reason-- the Republican hope that minorities would get sick of waiting in line and go home without casting their vote.</p>

<p>Honestly, what is the difference between forcing African-Americans and other minorities to use under-staffed, under-mechanized voting precincts and forcing blacks to use separate entrances at a movie theaters or sitting in the back of a bus or "separate but (not) equal" schools? In my book, none whatsoever.</p>

	<h3>More on Social Security</h3>
	
	<p>Apparently, the Congressional Budget Office has reported that we could easily keep Social Security going into the 22nd Century with a little bit of fiscal responsibility. </p>

<p>New York Times columnist Paul Krugman suspects the GOP is <a title="The New York Times > Opinion > Op-Ed Columnist: Inventing a Crisis" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/07/opinion/07krugman.html?oref=login&hp">inventing a crisis</a> in order to destroy Social Security. It's an interesting read. I'll see if I can find a link to the original report.</p>

<p>I understand the GOP has a distaste for federal programs that don't line their pockets, but why don't they at least have the guts to say "let's cancel it" without driving us into debt first?</p>

		<h2>12.05.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Initial Social Security thoughts</h3>
	
	<p>Darlene and I were debating with a conservative friend about Social Security the other night. Yes, we have a number of conservative friends-- they like us anyway.</p>

<p>The jist is we agree Social Security was technically in trouble as the baby boomers greatly outnumber us Gen Xers. (Yes, I am among the oldest of the slacker generation). How do we solve that problem and keep social security solvent? Pay into it but forfeit our retirement? That's what it looks like so far as they figure it'll be broke by the time I'm ready to retire.</p>

<p>The Republican option, as little as I've read about it so far, is to allow us younger pups to put money aside into dedicated retirement funds we could invest in the markets.</p>

<p>I'd like to hear more on possible solutions as it's obvious something needs to happen, but so far I see two problems with this solution. </p>

<p>First, in order to liberate the younger folks' money into these accounts, the government would have to borrow tanker loads of money. The problem is who will pay this debt? The same generations the solution is supposed to serve. I see this as a break even proposition at best. As it is, we are falling seriously in debt due to the tax cuts for the baby boomers. (Hey, after race wars and class wars, isn't the age wars next?)</p>

<p>Second, the markets can be awesome for growing nest eggs, my grandfather has some success in that category, but there is significant risk. If it crashes when you are getting ready to retire, you can be screwed for years.</p>

<p>I'm seeing this now in the library world. There is a generation of librarians that were about to retire causing a well publicized and anticipated shortage (thus jobs for me). However, many of these good folks are delaying that decision because they lost a chunk of their 401K accounts in the tech bubble burst. Now must work an extra number of years. </p>

<p>This post came about when I read today that librarians are not the only ones having problems with the markets. Apparently, our beloved Republican Senate Majority Leader Dr. Bill Frist lost <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26558-2004Dec1.html">nearly a half-million dollars</a> in campaign funds on the market in the last few years.</p>

<p>Finally, one more thought just hit me. When a government contractor (Halliburton) can't figure out what happened to a third of the money that was supposed to be used for Iraqi reconstruction and troop support, who do we trust to invest our money? Will the investment bankers be getting a free pass to abuse our accounts or will there be checks and balances built into the system?</p>

		<h2>12.03.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Bush was right</h3>
	
	<p>After a month of "oh Good Lord, what have we gotten ourselves into," I'm once again somewhat optimistic about our future.</p>

<p>Why? Because I realize that George W. Bush is right. </p>

<p>About one thing and eventually it will be the downfall of this fascist-leaning right-wing Republican leadership.</p>

<p>Repeatedly, Bush has said something along the lines of <a href="http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?ID=19486">this</a> (from Baptist Press News):<br />
<blockquote>"You cannot lead this world and our country to a better tomorrow unless you ... have a vision of a better tomorrow," the president said. "And I've got one, based upon a great faith that people do want to be free and live in democracy."<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>People do want to be free and live in democracy. Yes, Mr. President, indeed they do.</p>

<p>I truly believe people are willing to share and contribute toward the common welfare of the country and its citizens. Yet, beyond that, Americans really don't want the government to stick their nose in their business. We don't want a prosecutor in our closest. </p>

<p>Republicans assume that means we don't want them in our gun closet and for many that is entirely true. But from there they tend to lose track of reality. We don't want them checking out our religious beliefs, our sexuality, our livelihood, our breeding practices (or lack thereof), or (my personal pet peeve) our reading materials. You could easily add to this list on and on because we indeed all want freedom.</p>

<p>The problem is this freedom is slowly being infringed upon. There are many ways we should work together towards the common good, but there is a line and if their actions match their rhetoric, the Republicans will shortly be crossing that line and the pendulum will slowly swing the other way.</p>

<p>On one hand, it would be great to have more Latinos in positions of power, but doesn't it make you wonder when Bush appoints the former counsel of Enron to be the counsel of the White House?</p>

		<h2>11.06.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Sunny side up.</h3>
	
	<p>My mom wrote that she was too cynical to believe that Kerry could win. I wish I were that cynical. It would be a lot easier to take the loss.</p>

<p>Darlene and I are starting to recover from the shock. We're alternating as to which of us is depressed and which of us is angry as hell.</p>

<p>I kept thinking all the bad news would catch up with Bush. I kept thinking people would realize Kerry's immense value to our country. I underestimated how little people pay attention to the elections. I'm amazed how much people will put up with to have a candidate they agreed with. </p>

<p>I'm astounded at how truly awful the media was over the past year. There were so many issues and statements that needed analyzing and all they could do was talk about Cheney's daughter. Now Bush is talking about restructuring Social Security and our tax laws. The press barely mentioned these so-called priorities during the election. </p>

<p>Similarly, I wonder if they'll report on the true disaster Ohio and Florida has become. I'm not one to believe in conspiracies, but it is hard to swallow results when voters receive ballots pre-punched with Bush (if they punch Kerry the ballot is tossed as spoiled). It's hard to swallow when a machine gives Bush 4,000 more votes than are registered at the precinct. It's hard to swallow when 58,000 absentee ballots disappear. Way too many instances to believe fraud did not take place.</p>

<p>My father-in-law who lives in western Ohio said he saw no reason to vote when the election would get stolen anyway. I convinced him to vote anyway, but somehow I suspect it may be hard to get him to vote again.</p>

<p>As I look to the future I wonder how one combats against a party that submerges you in a swamp of lies and then screams we're playing dirty politics when we tell the public we're being drown. I wonder how one combats against a party that has mastered the art of fog and deceit. Mastered voter fraud and voter disenfranchisement in a way not seen since Jim Crow.</p>

<p>But most of all, please don't get me going about morality and politics. </p>

<p>On occasion, however, I've been able to pull back and look at how far we've managed to come. In theory we should have been defeated by the biggest landslide in history. Instead, 49 percent of the country said they did not want Bush as president.</p>

<p>Basically we're media starved and we need to work on how we explain our core values to the public. Beyond that I believe a good chunk of the infrastructure is in place for future victories. We have excellent fund raising and a GOTV machines. Even in Congress, we should have lost more than we did. We lost only four seats when the Republicans figured they'd gain seven seats in Texas alone. We also performed well at the state level gaining six legislatures. For example, Democrats rule the Colorado legislature for the first time in 50 years. We just have to keep pushing. </p>

<p>Second terms are messy and the Bush administration has shown no talent so far at getting themselves out of the muck, so here's to looking at 2006.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I'm going to see if I can get registered for spring classes. I'm looking at L520 Bibliographic Access and Control and L528 Collection Development.</p>

	<h3>Darlene's take</h3>
	
	<p>Still trying to accept the election results. I can not believe our country has made such a colossal mistake.  We will all pay for it.  Mark my words.</p>

<p>On the good side, the Republicans are going to have to clean up their own messes both here and abroad.  Kerry will not be blamed for not being able to fix everything Bush screwed up within 4 years.  The bad news is that he has 4 years to make it worse.</p>

<p>While I still question the validity of the election (no paper backup on many machines in Ohio and Florida so why even consider a recount, a machine in Ohio that tallied an extra 4000 or so votes - all for Bush, and both state's exit polls showing an entirely different story than the ballots). Kerry was correct in that there were not enough provisional ballots to change the result.  It seems that the gay rights issues, abortion, and just plain fear brought out many of the Republican voters. How the soaring deficit, struggling economy, jobs going overseas, environmental issues, not to mention the nightmare in Iraq can be ignored is beyond me.</p>

<p>So what do we do now?  We need to pay attention these next four years and hold this administration accountable.  Be as informed as possible. Read the news, instead of just getting 30 second sound bites on the television.  We have a great resource of national and international newspapers on the internet.</p>

<p>I am sorry for the kids as well. It was a very close race and they can be proud that our candidate did so well against so much misinformation.  Our country made a mistake.  It happens, and we must do everything we can to make sure it does not happen again.</p>

<p>I believe Kerry would have been a president who united our nation.  I am sorry we will not have the benefit of his wisdom, experience and patriotism.</p>

<p>I am praying for all of our futures,<br />
Darlene</p>

	<h3>I guess noone wanted to change horsemen mid-apocolypse</h3>
	
	<p>Well... I've once again been proven to be in the minority. Just about every candidate I voted for, with the exception of some county offices, lost.</p>

<p>Not only did Kerry lose, but we lost our Democratic state representative, we lost our Democrat U.S. Representative, we lost our Democrat governor.</p>

<p>I have tons of thoughts going through my mind. All I can hope is we can prove to be an effective "loyal opposition."</p>

<p>For better or worse, 33 percent of the country is living in a fantasy world. Unfortunately that's enough to elect a president. They believe what they are being told even when proof exists to the contrary. They are voting their fears and they are voting on social issues when we have the world at stake. </p>

<p>gotta get to work and live life again...</p>

	<h3>*sigh*</h3>
	
	<p>It's finally coming to an end. I'm feeling optimistic, but I hope Kerry can win by enough of a margin that our country can avoid lawsuit city. I read an allusion that Ohio is already full of lawsuits, though I haven't read anything specific.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I'm not sure which is worse, seeing results come in or not seeing results come in.</p>

<p>The exit polls looked very good for Kerry and that is good, but we lost a Democratic governor in Indiana and I may be losing my Democratic congressman.</p>

<p>I'd love to do something to different than to follow the results. But I don't think I could concentrate on something like watching a movie. </p>

<p>The results are looking discouraging, but yet it's too early to be discouraged. When only 25% of a state is reporting, it's too early to panic.</p>

<p>more later</p>

	<h3>Politics as unusual</h3>
	
	<p>To avoid being blue in a red state, I've been making <a href="calls.johnkerry.com">phone calls</a> for the Kerry-Edwards campaign. </p>

<p>It's a cool idea actually. Local organizers don't have the ability to reach out to every possible volunteer in the area-- especially in urban areas. Thus, they recruit folks from red states to help with the calling.</p>

<p>Of what I've read, the results have been beyond imagining. A canvassing captain in Florida expected about 40 folks to show up, but his event was on the calling list the night before and he ended up with more than 125 ready to go door-to-door.</p>

<p>Most of the calls I've made have been messages on answering machines, but it's been a lot of fun talking to KE supporters from battleground states. I talked to a couple pumped supporters who had attended the Kerry event in Madison, Wisc., that attracted 100,000. </p>

<p>It's also been fun because people are enthusiastic to talk with me. There was a cute machine message that said they'd try their "best" to return the call, but if I was a salesman to give it a "rest." I laughed and said I wasn't quite a salesman that I was a KE volunteer. They quickly answered the phone and said I didn't have to do any salesmanship that they had five Kerry voters in the household. Two of them will volunteer to boot. Priceless.</p>

<p>I finally had to quit tonight because they rain out of phone numbers to call!</p>

<p>Meanwhile we had another good weekend of sales in the shop. It didn't hurt that the Indiana Main Street Conference was in town. Good times.</p>

<p>Also here's followup to a recent post, here is an update on recent <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2004/10/31/192155/73">voter fraud and disenfranchisement</a> efforts by the Republicans.</p>

<p>I smell desperation.</p>

	<h3>Where's Jimmy Carter when you need him?</h3>
	
	<p>While I'm somewhat discouraged that my vote won't particularly count toward the electoral college, I am glad not to be living in Ohio. Or should I say, I'm glad I won't be voting in Ohio.</p>

<p>I've been reading about the Republican strategy for winning the White House and, to be honest, it has nothing to do with winning. Essentially it has everything to do with keeping as many Democrats away from the polls as possible. To have any chance they need to keep the vote down. </p>

<p>In Ohio, the GOP has 8,000 Jim Crow-style challengers lined up to contest as many voters as possible. Even if that doesn't disqualify many people, it is intended to reduce the process to molassas with the hopes of getting voters discouraged and making them leave. And when Kerry does win, they plan to argue that they couldn't stop the voting fraud and claim that Kerry stole the election.</p>

<p>Thus the period after the election may well be more disgusting than the period prior to the election. Sometimes I wonder if we need some UN election observers to keep this thing fair. (note: I just saw that Ohio's Secretary of State has refused foreign observes, a first.)</p>

<p>I think it's fair to say that no one wants voter fraud. I want a fair election. Yet, I have a problem with anyone trying to supress the vote. The Democrats have focused on creating greater participation and in getting out the vote. Isn't that what democracy is about? Voters participating?</p>

<p>Here's a website that is tracking all of the <a href="http://vote2004.eriposte.com/">voter supression</a> activities.</p>

<p>Also, here are a couple articles out of the dozens that are emerging on the problem from the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/3956129.stm">BBC</a> and the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A62645-2004Oct25.html">Washington Post</a>. Oh yes, now there are <a href="http://www.local10.com/politics/3854230/detail.html">58,000 absentee ballots missing</a> in Broward Co., Florida. </p>

<p>This all stinks like rotten fish to me. Darlene and I contributed to the cause already, but I'm starting to think we'll have to contribute to the legal defense fund as well.</p>

	<h3>Big dog speaks volumes</h3>
	
	<p>The photos from Philadelphia are absolutely amazing. I was impressed with 40,000 in Portland and 30,000 in Minneapolis, but it blows my mind that more than 80,000 people would turn out for a political rally. Here's a snipet from Clinton's speach...</p>

<blockquote>"In the closing days of this campaign, John Kerry is going on being John Kerry -- talking about his hopes for America; his plans for America; his commitment to our security and our prosperity. 

<p>Now, one of Clinton's laws of politics is this, if one candidate's trying to scare you, and the other one is trying to get you to think, if one candidate is appealing to your fears and the other one is appealing to your hopes, you better vote for the person who wants you to think and hope."</blockquote></p>

<p>He may have been a sleeze, but Clinton certainly knows how to capture a certain political truth.</p>

		<h2>10.24.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>In-laws voting and rallying</h3>
	
	<p>Darlene and I visited her parents this weekend. It was a rather interesting weekend to say the least. On one hand it was fun playing with all the nieces and nephews, on the other hand it was a rather political weekend.</p>

<p>Darlene has a split family politically. Her parents are labor Democrats. Two of her sisters are voting for Kerry and the other two are voting for Bush (last time around it was 3-1 Bush I believe). Who knows about her brothers. One would probably vote for Bush, but isn't planning on voting.</p>

<p>Now you know I can get on my high horse and rant away. Darlene is hotter about this election than I am. Her father is twice as growly as Darlene. He has been railing against Bush for three years now, yet oddly he had no plans on voting this year "Why bother? He'll steal the election anyway."</p>

<p>I'm not sure when the last time he had voted. Maybe the 1968 "Humphrey/Muskie" sticker out in his barn gives me a clue. I told him I wouldn't listen to him complain about Bush unless he actually cast a ballot this year. I don't think he believed me until I downloaded the registration forms off the Internet. I think that did it. He actually filled them out and sent them in.</p>

<p>You notice I said "them." I didn't expect my mother-in-law to vote. I've never heard her comment one line about politics in more than 15 years, but during our last visit she said she wanted to vote for Kerry. She had not voted for at least 30 years.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, their registrations were somehow split up. His reached Wapakoneta on Oct. 4 and he sent in their absentee ballot requests soon thereafter. His was granted and hers was not. They said she wasn't registered.</p>

<p>Well at their request, I called the Board of Elections and found out that her registration didn't arrive until Oct. 18, after her request was rejected.</p>

<p>So, Darlene and I had the honor of taking her mom into town to vote for the first time in an eon. While I was at it, I hand delivered her father's ballot to the election board. Two votes for Kerry banked in Ohio.</p>

<p>On the way home we found the Auglaize County Democratic Headquarters open. We stopped and got all kinds of goodies. We got her father a Kerry yard sign. We got a Kerry bumper sticker for our new van and each of us got a Kerry button. Finally, I landed two tickets for today's Edwards rally in Lima, not far from where two of her sisters live.</p>

<p>That night we had a very good turkey for dinner and three of Darlene's sisters came. Politics was obviously the main topic of conversation. I think Darlene was begging for it by wearing her Kerry pin in mixed company.</p>

<p>My wonderful brother-in-law said he believed Bush was the "moral" candidate. What can I say, I lost it on him, lying about war is not moral, Abu Ghraib is not moral, handing down debt and a dirty planet to my nieces and nephews is not moral, instituting Jim Crow type election supression is not moral. Either way, once the ice was broken though, we all had a very civilized, even fun political conversation.</p>

<p>Finally, after everyone went home, we were about to go to bed for the night. It was late and we had to get up early for the four hour drive so I could get to work by 12:30 today. </p>

<p>It was at that point that her father put "Fahrenheit  9-11" into the DVD player. After watching the first 10 minutes were were absolutely hooked. We couldn't stop watching it.</p>

<p>I think it could have been better. There were some connections that could have been made clearer, but the overall impact left me literally shaking. Listening to the parents of the dead soldiers was absolutely heart breaking.</p>

<p>It amazed me that not five months before the 9-11, just about every administration official said, on camera, that Saddam was not a threat. Their story certainly changed. They conveniently took good advantage of the news.</p>

<p>Watching the scenes from Iraq was enlightening. People have told me they do not believe we should know what's going on in a war zone. They don't believe reporters should be there. I disagree, especially after watching the movie. I think everyone should witness a little bit of the carnage. It's good for the soul to see our soldiers put their lives and souls on the line for us. It's good for the soul to see the real impact of war. </p>

<p>Finally, we just heard back from her sister who attended this afternoon's Edwards rally and she sent us a few photos. She said they had a great time. I look forward to hearing what their reaction to Edwards was.</p>

		<h2>09.15.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>A breathe of fresh air from Salem</h3>
	
	<p>I'm thinking the way to follow the campaign is to read the local papers in communities where the candidates appear. In the era of the Internet, this is certainly possible.</p>

<p>The local reporters don't have to listen to the candidates day after day. They are not jaded and as a result, they actually report on what's being said instead of looking for the little things to pick apart.</p>

<p>The second advantage is they understand the local issues and question the candidates on those issues.</p>

<p>Here's a decent example of an interview with John Edwards from <a title="State News - StatesmanJournal.com" href="http://news.statesmanjournal.com/article.cfm?i=86729">the Statesman-Journal</a> in Salem, Oregon.</p>

<p>I've heard the basics before, but because they took the time to ask questions, there are details here I have not read in the national news. Things that make a decent amount of sense.</p>

<p>For example, instead of capping malpractice suits at $100,000 as Bush has proposed ($100K? a life has got to be worth more than that)-- Edwards said they would propose that lawsuits be vetted by an independent body of experts before even being admitted to the courts. If it's frivilous, the buck stops. </p>

<p>I'd be interested in hearing more details, but that certainly sounds better than generically cutting off the rights of the injured.</p>

<p>[<b>Update based on a comment</b>: Good to have your comment! Mind you, you missed the point of what I was trying to say. Though I admit I probably didn't say it well enough to begin with. </p>

<p>The breathe of fresh air wasn't from Edwards, he is simply trying to get his message across. Bush stays on message extremely well, usually committing the same "sin" you mention of not answering the question. That, however, is par for the political course.</p>

<p>Rather, it's the reporter himself who is a breath of fresh air. The media has been in the "he said-she said-I'm outta here" mode of reporting for some time now. Very few reporters are asking relevant questions (as this reporter actually did). Very few are actually telling the audience whether the candidate is telling the truth, bending the truth, ignoring the truth or just out and out lying (and repeating them to make them the truth). Thus media has been doing a piss-poor job. Thus, I'm glad the reporter actually asked questions his readers cared about.</p>

<p>Finally, I agree that multi-million dollar lawsuits are a good way of driving doctors out of business. However, when you get a real quack, limiting damages to $100,000 as Bush has proposed is not right. </p>

<p>Case in point? Dr. Tom Coburn, Republican Senate candidate from Oklahoma. He admits to sterilizing underaged women. Doing this to girls who probably don't know any better is disgusting. Based on the one woman's charge, it makes me wonder how many of the others were under shady conditions. Thus $100,000 is just a slap on the wrist. If it is all true, he should be out of business. </p>

	<h3>The ultimate flip-flop</h3>
	
	<p>In the war against terrorism, President Bush has stated: "I think you can create conditions so that those who use terror as a tool are less acceptable in parts of the world."</p>

<p>I have a question, Mr. President. Why is using terror as a tool acceptable here in this part of the world? To the point, why have you not condemned the arrival of <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0409010148sep01,1,6705318.story?coll=chi-newsnationworld-hed">terrorists</a> who landed at an airport outside Miami last month to a homecoming celebration?</p>

<p>If we as a nation really want to fight terrorism, if we as a nation really want to be the leader in this fight, we must do a few things.</p>

<p>First, we must truly cooperate with other nations. No cop goes into the streets on his or on her own. Their back is always being watched by trained and able forces. Similarly, it is ideal when the officer knows the neighborhood is also watching his back. He needs to know he can do his job without fear the neighborhood will join in on the wrong side of the fight.</p>

<p>That's is why we need cooperation from other nations. Without it, we're sitting ducks. That is why a coalition of the willing is not enough. If there is a weak link in the chainmail of our defense, the terrorists will find it. They are very mobile, very independent, can very easily take advantage of this weakness. </p>

<p>Secondly, to get that cooperation, we must listen to the wisdom of former Texas Governor George W. Bush. During the second presidential debate in 2000 he stated: "If we're an arrogant nation, they'll resent us. If we're a humble nation but strong, they'll welcome us."</p>

<p>Indeed, we must not only fight the war against terrorism, but we must also take the moral high ground. To do this we must acknowledge that "a terrorist is a terrorist is a terrorist." Not that "a terrorist is not a terrorist when he is a freedom fighter against a country whose leadership we would love to see overthrown."</p>

<p>Yes, this would make our foreign policy more difficult, but at the same time we would certainly start getting cooperation because no country could tell us we need to "practice what we preach."</p>

<p>Again, let's start here at home. How can we as a nation argue against terrorism when we let a wanted terrorist slip our grips into the wilds of Honduras? How could we let his henchmen join in a celebration outside Miami?</p>

<p>Could it be that we probably trained them to begin with? Could it be you'd rather win re-election rather than fight terrorism?</p>

<p>[<b>Update</b>: this happened a couple of weeks ago, I just read about it on <a href="http://www.dailykos.com">DailyKos.com</a>. Here are two columns from foreign policy writers. The first from the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/commentary/la-op-sweig12sep12,1,2644811.story?coll=la-sunday-commentary">LA Times</a> and the second from the <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/opinion/sfl-08forum07sep11,0,5886862.story?coll=sfla-news-opinion">South Florida Sun-Sentinel</a>.]</p>

		<h2>09.01.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Twilight zone quality</h3>
	
	<p>Interesting week to say the least...</p>

<p>In the outside world::</p>

<p>Poor Paul Hamm is still suffering at the hands of the FIG (don't give up the gold).</p>

<p>Bush says we can't win the war on terrorism (then "flip-flops" like a fish out of water trying to explain it all).</p>

<p>I feel bad for whomever wrote the speech the Bush girls gave as they'll be living out the rest of the year in the gulag.</p>

<p>In our life::</p>

<p>I spoke before a plan commission meeting where I'm quoted as saying the word <a href="http://www.madisoncourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=4&SubSectionID=263&ArticleID=19852">"holistically" </a> before the board. I don't remember it. Though I admit I don't remember much of what I did say-- it's amazing how you quickly one can become a deer in the headlights. </p>

<p>Today, our assistant director and I attended a grant writing workshop where we were supposed to have come prepared to start working on writing a grant. There was only one problem... no one told us. It was supposed to be in the confirmation letter, but it was not. Fortunately (and unfortunately) I have 30 days to come up with a grant idea and write the proposal. I'll obviously be meeting with the director in the morning. We couldn't pull one out of the air that didn't fit our plans and I already have a grant I'm trying to administer (as well as the 2005-2007 technology plan I'm working on).</p>

<p>Darlene meanwhile has pots all over the place in the studio. Literally on every exposed surface. It's a lot of fun to watch (especially as the shelves are getting bare and we have a show coming up).</p>

<p>That's life on the river's edge.</p>

	<h3>Mother Nature vs. Dubya</h3>
	
	<p>My father-in-law who lives outside of Lima, Ohio, reports that Dubya was speaking there today.</p>

<p>He watched Bush on the local Lima station speaking at the new high school when a huge storm rolled in and knocked out the power toward the end of his speech.</p>

<p>He then apparently couldn't get out of town on the pre-planned blockade route because of flash-flooding as more than 2 inches of rain fell in 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Hmmm.... is mother nature trying to tell us something? Don't we wish. Anyway it'd be lost on Lima which is very Republican-- so much so that every Republican nominee has visited the town.</p>

<p>You can access the paper's website at <a href="http://www.limanews.com">LimaNews.com</a> Unfortunately, the site didn't work quite right with my Mac browser so I couldn't verify the information with the paper.</p>

	<h3>Games for Change</h3>
	
	<p>OK, so watching Kerry's lead slowly disappear causes one to growl and fret. So Bush has managed to avoid talking about the issues for a couple weeks which, again, causes one to growl and fret. So what?</p>

<p>Thinking about it for a couple of days though, I get the feeling that after the convention Bush will peak out at about 50% support and watch it dwindle away.</p>

<p>Bush has to deal with failures across the board and new ones that keep popping up left and right. He won't be able to control the tempo of the debate. His supporters will go "nucular" with attacks against Kerry and while that will keep some of the electorate undecided, it won't improve Bush's standings. Recent polls are proving that.</p>

<p>The key I think is whether Bush can actually run on his record and offer something to a country that has said it distinctly wants change.</p>

<p>None of this is original thinking. Read <a href="http://www.dailykos.com">Daily Kos</a> and you'll come to the same conclusions.</p>

<p>I think fretting is the result of being blue in a red state, you get the feeling living here there isn't much you can do about it all. However, I think stealing an idea from MoveOn will help.  A couple in Massachusettes held a "Games for Change" night as a fundraiser. </p>

<p>We can get a bunch of folks who want some change in the country together here in America's most beautiful rivertown and play games to raise money. Everyone can play games and bid on how they'll go (the bids don't have to be even) and all winnings go into a central pot. Playing volleyball. "We'll bet $2 that we'll make the next point." Win or lose the money goes into the kitty. Start with sports and finish with cards. </p>

<p>Maybe we can decide on a destination for the money up front, maybe we'll hold a vote halfway through the evening as to where the money will go. The DNC? MoveOn? ACT? Congressional candidates? a percentage to each?</p>

<p>The bottom line is we'll have a blast, figure out who we can comiserate with and we'll raise some change for change.</p>

		<h2>08.27.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Welcome to the chess match</h3>
	
	<p>I think people are starting to realize that slime is part of greater Bushco's general methods of operation. </p>

<p>Depending on what kind of attack comes next, Kerry may have partial immunity and be able to pull off a Reagan "there you go again."</p>

<p>However, I think Bush may have won this round by avoiding having to fight the round.</p>

<p>In his Cooper Union speech, Kerry was right about the biggest loss in the Swifty fiasco. Discussion of the issues has come to a halt in this campaign.</p>

<p>Bush has largely been able to avoid intense coverage of increasing poverty, declining health insurance and reports about Abu Graib. He's able to keep the negatives to a minimum as he's about to grab the convention limelight. </p>

<p>The coverage is there, but Kerry can't pounce on it when he's awash in defending against the slime. </p>

<p>Similarly, this is turning into a big chess match. Everyone attacking the Swifties has in turn given Bush the platform to hammer against Moveon, et al. </p>

<p>I don't know if the public is getting enough information from the "so-called liberal media" to know the difference between Moveon and the Swifties. (The swifties have few huge contributors, Moveon has thousands upon thousands of small contributors).</p>

<p>Thus, I think Bush might be getting away with whitewashing all the groups as "shadowy."</p>

<p>Again, the ability to avoid bad coverage. I'll credit him there, but I don't think his luck can last forever.</p>

	<h3>Bush not talking to mainline churches?</h3>
	
	<p>I wasn't surprised when Dubya skipped out on the NAACP, but I am shocked that he hasn't spoken with the National Council of Churches. </p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/07/06/evangelicals/">Salon</a>:</p>

<blockquote>"Bush has shown an ideological commitment to the literalist Christian tradition at the expense of the broader view of the larger religious community," said the Rev. Bob Edgar, general secretary of the National Council of Churches, a mainline Protestant group. "He is the first president not to meet with the leadership of mainline Christian traditions since George Washington. We've been able to talk with the prime minister of Britain and the chancellor of Germany, but not our own president. And we would have had some positive things to say," Edgar said, mentioning Bush's $15 billion international HIV-AIDS prevention and treatment program. "But on moral questions, like the morality of going to war, we felt the president should have listened more carefully."</blockquote>

<p>Then again, maybe it's not surprising. But still, these are Methodists, Presbyterians and Episcopalians.</p>

	<h3>At least the press is starting to pay attention</h3>
	
	<p>It's been my impression that the media has been extremely lazy in it's election coverage this year. </p>

<p>Cable television hosts have been seen holding official GOP talking point sheets. Can't they come up with their own analysis and opinion? Reporters accept opposing side views without fact checking them.</p>

<p>Just now they're starting to pay attention to whether the Swift Boaters is fact or fiction. They should have looked into it a long time ago.</p>

<p>At least I'm not the only one feeling that way. The Columbia Journalism Review in its Campaign Desk blog <a title="CJR Campaign Desk: Archives" href="http://www.campaigndesk.org/archives/000844.asp">commented</a> on the press and the media's Swift Boat fiasco:</p>

<blockquote>In a campaign season where the candidates have demonstrated a willingness (even eagerness) to misinform voters, it's the responsibility of the press to inform the public about who's enlightening us with fact and who's misleading us with fiction.</blockquote>

<p>Come on y'all WAKE UP!</p>

	<h3>Here comes the slime</h3>
	
	<p>Man it's going to be a long campaign. I need to remind myself I only have to survive another 72 days of this junk. </p>

<p>I knew the slime would start flying eventually. But now that I've seen the Swift Boat Veterans for the Truth ads, I'm sickened nonetheless.<br />
 <br />
Unlike Bush, I don't believe that independent advertising should be halted. There are viewpoints in the world beyond Bush and Kerry's. Yet those ads should have a measure of truth.</p>

<p>The Swift Boaters obviously have a beef with Kerry and with how they were treated when they returned home from Vietnam. </p>

<p>In interviews the Swift Boat Vets said they felt betrayed by Kerry and his anti-war protests when he returned from Vietnam. The brush Kerry painted on the war, as he described the attrocities that took place in that country, was wide indeed. Rightly or wrongly, the vets felt they were tarred with the same stroke.</p>

<p>If they want to advertise that fact, that is legit. Kerry himself admitted that his protests and testimony before Congress echoed a youthful anger and he wished he had toned down the language. He told the truth, but the result are wounds that, in Larry Thurlow's words, are "still bleeding." This is fact. I feel for these guys, they were honorable men who were trapped in a war gone awry and not of their making.</p>

<p>But to lie about events and take Kerry's words out of context is inexcusable. </p>

<p>The NYTimes, the Washington Post and an editor from the Chicago Tribune, himself was a swift boat captain on the scene, have all refuted the lies. But the Texas GOP moneybags have plenty of money to keep throwing the muck.</p>

<p>I'm not sure I want to know how this will turn out.</p>

<p>(sorry for the lack of links. I've read all this, but I'm tired and don't feel like digging this moment).</p>

	<h3>Is Bush on the verge of panic?</h3>
	
	<p>While there wasn't a so-called "bounce" from the convention on the national level, there are some pretty amazing trends developing. Indeed, I'm starting to smell blood.</p>

<p>Kerry, while not perfect, has been clearly enjoying himself and attracting astoundingly large crowds during his cross-country tour.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Bush campaign has been a whimper and seems to be on the verge of panic. (Though for equal opportunity, they're saying the Kerry campaign is in panic mode).</p>

<p>Take Oregon.</p>

<p>The photos from Kerry's rally in Portland look more like the Simon & Garfunkle Central Park concert than they do a political rally... more than 50,000 people showed up in the Rose City.... 50,000. </p>

<p>In contrast, the Bush campaign hands out tickets to a select citizens who sign pledges to vote for Bush and has police filter out anyone wearing questionable clothing. Lord forbid if a Democrat or Libertarian were to slipping in. He then holds a scripted "question and answer" session.</p>

<p>Choices of campaign stops is also interesting. Both Kerry and Bush are visiting swing states, but Kerry is visiting Republican cities.  </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com">electoral college</a> is looking very bad for Bush right now -- 327-211 Kerry. </p>

<p>Obviously, swing states such as Ohio, Missouri and Minnesota can swing, but Bush is having trouble holding a lead in states that should be solid Red by now-- we're talking North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas and McCain's Arizona. In Florida, Kerry holds a 47-41 lead.</p>

<p>Bush's "America's turning a corner" stump speech was pulled because jobs numbers took a surprising downward turn and we'll end up with about 1,000 dead Americans in Iraq by time the GOP convention comes around. Meanwhile, we still haven't heard word one of his second term agenda other than allusions to eliminating the income tax and war with Iran.</p>

<p>The result is that we're watching slime fly everywhere. They're trying to slime Kerry's well documented war record (as opposed to Bush who still can't prove he wasn't AWOL) and they're pulling a "Fox" by taking Kerry's words out of context for slime material. </p>

<p>All signs of panic.</p>

<p>Mind you, he still has his convention. While his State of the Union fell flat on its face (do you still hear about Mars?), he may come up with something. There are also in unpredictables. So who knows...</p>

<p>Kerry still needs to fight like he's behind, but I wouldn't be surprised if this is the start of something bigger. Much bigger.</p>

	<h3>Forward thinking John E.</h3>
	
	<p>Interesting article from the <a title="washingtonpost.com: Edwards Sets Self Apart on Foreign Policy" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A37644-2004Jul8?language=printer">Washington Post</a> on how John Edwards has had his mind on foreign policy over the past few years.</p>

<p>I found the article courtesy of the Columbia Journalism Review's <a href "http://www.campaigndesk.org/archives/000721.asp">Campaign Desk</a>. It's an echo, but I have to agree that it's nice to see someone in the media actually try to answer the oft-quoted question of whether Edwards is qualified to be a 21st Century VP.</p>

	<h3>Majority tyranny</h3>
	
	<p>Thinking about it more, I believe all groups should be politically active. That's the freedom we have. Organizations need to be able to flex the power of numbers.</p>

<p>I think what I fear is majority tyranny.</p>

<p>For example, the Republicans as the majority in the house have literally created and passed legislation without as much as a word from Democrats in the process.</p>

<p>Then, when the Democrats try to slow down the process to get their two cents into the dollar being created, the Republicans hollar that the Democrats are trying to subvert the majority will. This is amplified by the Republicans' mantra of treason everytime someone disagrees with them.</p>

<p>Frustrating, no?</p>

<p>Conservatives by definition want to keep things they way they were (or for the cynical, keep things the way they thought they were). Yet, for better or worse, our country is changing. It's multi-cultural and multi-religious and soon the "white man" will become a minority.</p>

<p>In this kind of setting, majority tyranny is simply not a "good thing."</p>

<p>What does this have to do with church-state separation? Basically, a poltical party can bring with it a specific brand of religion that in turn can impinge on the freedom of other practices.</p>

<p>As Thomas Jefferson wrote, "We hold these truths to be self evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."</p>

<p>It's hard to have the liberty to say your peace or to pursue one's version of happiness, beit worshipping Christ, Allah or money when one group has the handle on every control and drop-kicks anyone who wants to suggest the boat is capsizing.</p>

<p>To me this freedom needs to be spread around more than it is. Both to where Christians seeking power can exercise their beliefs in freedom and so those who don't have the same beliefs can have the same freedoms.</p>

<p>Schools need to be open to folks who practice their religion. Christian groups wants to meet after school on school property? So be it. Voluntary meetings around the flag pole for a prayer before school? Go for it. If a teacher wants to join in, fine.</p>

<p>The key is that their practices should not impinge on the freedom of others to do the same. Thus the same teacher at the pole before school should not be leading the prayer in homeroom.</p>

<p>It's not a matter of political correctness or "special rules" for minorities. Rather, it's following the spirit of that Declaration, of following the Golden Rule and simply respecting your fellow human beings. Everyone should be made comfortable and welcomed as who they are.</p>

<p>Thus, the majority can run the government, but they shouldn't "rule" the country. That went out with King George III.</p>

	<h3>Bishops to campaign for Bush?</h3>
	
	<p>Frequent church-goers more often vote Republican and there is no surprise that Bush is aiming to take advantage of this demographic.</p>

<p>However, I am amazed at the depth at which Bush and the Republicans are attempting to narrow the separation of church and state to tilt the equation in their favor.</p>

<p>Two articles of interest.</p>

<p>The Washington Post reports that the house Republicans inserted a rider in the latest fast-track "jobs" bill that would <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26244-2004Jun8.html">allow pastors more freedom to engage in political activism</a> without their churches losing their tax-exempt status.</p>

<p>The article also notes a Bush campaign email that the campaign is looking to identify 1,600 "friendly congregations" in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Penalties for code violations would also be dialed down with the first violation being only a week's worth of taxes. That's pretty cheap political advertising.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <i>National Catholic Reporter</i> Vatican correspondent John L. Allen Jr. <a href="http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/word/">wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>During his visit, Bush asked the Vatican to push the American Catholic bishops to be more aggressive politically on family and life issues.... A Vatican official told NCR June 9 that in his meeting with Cardinal Angelo Sodano and other Vatican officials, Bush said, �Not all  the American bishops are with me� on the cultural issues. The implication was that he hoped the Vatican would nudge them toward more explicit  activism.</blockquote>

<p>I have hard time believing that 44 years ago people were worried that the Vatican would run a Kennedy White House. Now we apparently have Bush asking the Vatican to help him run his campaign for the White House.</p>

<p>I hope to have more thoughts on this tomorrow...</p>

	<h3>Reagan</h3>
	
	<p>Everyone's flag is at half mast for the death of former President Reagan. While I disagreed with much of his politics, I bow my head in respect for the man. May he rest in peace.</p>

<p>Similarly may Nancy find peace that his life is certainly regarded as legendary. More so, I hope she succeeds in energizing the stem cell research that could have helped her husband.</p>

<p>As far as Reagan's legacy, I see it as mixed. On one hand he presented America as optimistic and able. In this alone, he was pretty amazing. He also was smart in his dealings with the Soviet Union. While many attribute this to a beefed up military, I think it was more likely his interactions with Gorbachev that did the trick.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he handed down a set of foreign policy experts to Bush 46 who landed him in this Iraq mess. It's little wonder as many were also involved in the Iran-Contra scandal and the atrosities in central America.</p>

<p>He wasn't most popular president in modern history (he's in the middle of the pack with Clinton), but he is certainly a legend. His style crystalized a vision in Republicans' mind of how the presidency should be.</p>

<p>What's odd is while Kerry gave a very respectful speach about Reagan at the University of Toledo and suspended campaigning until after the state funeral, Bush is using his death as campaign fodder. Check out his campaign website which has literally been <a href="http://www.georgewbush.com/">transformed.</a></p>

<p>I find it overdone, but considering how bad of shape Bush is in, you can't blame him for trying to see if some of Reagan's shine can rub off on him.</p>

	<h3>Tom Toles</h3>
	
	<p>When it comes to editiorial cartoonists, Tom Toles is ahead of the pack. </p>

<p>His style is simplistic, but effective drawings with a hatchmarks of pen and ink for harsh shading. His wit is cutting and oh so effective.</p>

<p>For years he worked for my hometown paper, The Buffalo News, teasing local and national politicians. But a couple of years ago he got one the plumest job assignment on the planet as editorial cartoonist of The Washington Post.</p>

<p>The timing could not have been better for Toles. Indeed, the Bush administration may be making his job a little too easy. He's shooting the Bush fish in the barrel. Even if the topics are easy, Toles is on a tear.</p>

		<h2>05.07.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>It's time to go to the bullpen for relief</h3>
	
	<p>Reading about the darkening picture in Iraq, I am convinced that a change of leadership is an absolute neccesity.</p>

<p>The atrocities in the prison camps are absolutely beyond imagination and absolutely inexcusable. </p>

<p>Here are two articles <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=518&u=/ap/20040505/ap_on_re_eu/britain_iraq_us_prisoner_abuse&printer=1">from the AP</a> and from the UK's <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1211374,00.html">Guardian</a> newspaper.</p>

<p>We're better than this folks and the only way we can prove that to the world (let alone the Iraqis) is to not only to punish those soldiers and contractors responsible, but to fire the administration.</p>

<p>We've lost all credibility as a country that cares about the Iraqi people and it comes at a time when we need to win their "hearts and minds" the most.</p>

<p>Bringing in a new administration would tell the world we still want to fight terrorism, but that we also respect the world in the process.</p>

<p>How did all this happen?</p>

<p>It appears that Bush has no control whatsoever over this situation.</p>

<p>For example, it appears the president didn't even learn of the photos depicting the atrocities from his own personnel. He saw them on television.</p>

<p>The prisons are not even run by the military but by hired contractors seemingly above military law. The contractors in turn are hiring workers with no experience whatsoever to do high level intelligence work.</p>

<p>The Internetional Red Cross meanwhile has been <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/07/politics/07RIGH.html">complaining to senior officials</a> about the attrocities for months. </p>

<p>While on Arab television Bush didn't even have the heart to apologize for the troops and contractors ultimately under his command. He's the commander in chief. The buck stops with him. I'm glad he has finally started by apologizing to the Jordanian monarch, but he's not an Iraqi.</p>

<p>The bottom line is he started a war without a plan for occupying the country and now he's suffering the consequences. These are just the symptoms of the disease.</p>

<p>There are good reasons for being in Iraq and in the long run things will be better for the Iraqi people.</p>

<p>But the timing was bad (we still don't have Osama Bin Laden) and the implementation has been even worse.</p>

<p>As former owner of the Texas Rangers, Bush understands that when your starting pitcher is being bombed, you pull him if you have any desire to win the game.</p>

<p>If there's any hope for "winning" this war. If there's any hope of gaining the confidence of Iraqis. If there's any hope of gaining the cooperation in the world-wide war on terrorism, it's time to go to the bullpen.</p>

	<h3>There they go again</h3>
	
	<p>If there was a man who avoided service in Vietnam and left the National Guard without completing his service, you'd think he'd keep his mouth shut about the service of others.</p>

<p>No, instead he tries to knock them down a notch or two so he doesn't look AS bad.</p>

<p>While I guess this makes good politics, but it's as close to being as slimy as you can get.</p>

<p>John McCain, Max Cleland and John Kerry all went overseas and killed for our country. They watched their compatriots be killed. Between the three of them, they've seen enough blood for a lifetime times three.</p>

<p>Hardly anyone in the current administration outside Powell and the Pentagon has seen a fraction of their service. Yet, they're on a tear to smear them.</p>

<p>The Bush folks in 2000 started what many call a "whisper campaign" questioning McCain's <a href="http://dir.salon.com/politics/feature/2001/05/31/jeffords/index.html">"mental stability"</a> coming back from Vietnam.</p>

<p>In TV ads they compared triple-amputee Max Cleland to <a href="http://www.macon.com/mld/macon/4264879.htm">Osama Bin-Laden.</a></p>

<p>I know he tried smearing Gore's service as well, but I can't find an article right this moment. </p>

<p>Now there's an underground campaign saying John Kerry didn't deserve this third Purple Heart stating <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/1519/4739243.html">he wasn't injured enough.</a> </p>

<p>Good grief. Kerry requested to go to Vietnam. He put his life on the line time after time to fulfill his missions and protect the soldiers under his command. He did and all the other troops that were there did. Each and every one of them should be honored.</p>

<p>Bush and his crew, avoided all of it. Who is he to sling any slime? Yet, here they are slinging it again.</p>

<p>What can I say it makes me growly.</p>

	<h3>Nice political analogy</h3>
	
	<p>There's a new online political magazine I'm enjoying called <a href="http://gadflyer.com">The Gadflyer</a>. The site started up on March 15th and calls for an aggressive progressive agenda. </p>

<p>They're a bit of a throwback to pre-1970s Democrats who didn't hesistate to throw punches as needed to accomplish their agenda. Yet, the issues and solutions are 21st century.</p>

<p>They started a feature today called "Reply All" for email interviews with newsmakers. First up is <a href="http://gadflyer.com/replyall/">Senator John Kerry</a>.</p>

<p>One reason I like Kerry for his "weakness" of giving nuanced answers. To me it shows me the guy actually thinks, that he looks at all sides of an issue and actually takes them into consideration.</p>

<p>Mind you, it's hard to get nuanced answer in an email, so the feature is mildly disappointing in that manner. However, I did like part of his final answer. </p>

<blockquote>
<b>John Kerry:</b> ...
I love the challenge involved in playing hockey. Wayne Gretzky was asked why he was such a good hockey player and he always said, "You know most guys go to where the puck is. I go to where the puck is going to be." For me, I think that's also a statement about life and politics. It's about which issues you choose to fight for and how much you're willing to look toward tomorrow's challenges today.</blockquote>

	<h3>'Texas governor's race gets Kinky'</h3>
	
	<p>OK, I'm glad I read the newspaper. <br />
The <a title="HoustonChronicle.com - Texas governor's race gets Kinky" href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/metropolitan/2433090">Houston Chronicle</a> is reporting that author Kinky Friedman is planning to run for Texas governor as an independent in 2006.</p>

<blockquote>"There are no skeletons in my closet. They are all bleaching on a beach somewhere," he said.   

<p>You want to know Kinky's stand on gun control?  "I do not carry a gun myself, so if someone is going to shoot me, they better remember to bring their own weapon."   </p>

<p>On abortion?  "I am not pro-life, I am not pro-choice, I am pro football."</blockquote>   <br />
Do I have to wait until 2006? I could use some of this levity this year.</p>

	<h3>GOP calling the kettle black</h3>
	
	<p>I should stop reading the newspaper. It just gets my blood boiling. </p>

<p><a title="Two Blamed for Senate Computer Snooping" href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/national/AP-Judiciary-Memos.html">Two Republican Senate aides</a> are blamed for computer snooping and conservatives are blaming the Democrats.</p>

<p>The two aides snagged hundreds upon hundreds of confidential files from a Democratic computer server after one of them learned how to get in by watching a systems administrator.</p>

<p>The aides excuse? The files weren't protected well. If the guys watched an office worker punch in a door combination then used the same combo to walk in and get papers, it would be theft and B&E.</p>

<p>In the meantime, conservatives are calling for an investigation into the content of the stolen memos. They say the Demcrats "colluded" with liberal political groups to block conservative judicial nominees-- specifically conservative minority nominees.</p>

<p>Well, they can have their so-called "investigation." </p>

<p>While they're at it, maybe they can also find out:<br />
<li>Who <a href="http://www.prospect.org/webfeatures/2004/02/kuttner-r-02-26.html">Vice President Dick Chaney</a> "colluded" with when he created the administration's energy policy. <br />
<li>Why Chaney can still profit from Haliburton on stock options even as the company reams the military for millions upon millions.<br />
<li>Who outted Vicki Plame as a CIA operative and who knew of the smear campaign.<br />
<li>Why the National Security Council was discussing invading Iraq just days after walking into the Oval Office for the first time.</p>

<p>Leave it up to the GOP to call a kettle black when their own kettle is whistling with boiling water.</p>

	<h3>You gotta wonder about their priorities</h3>
	
	<p>The Bush administration was so busy setting up the Iraq war that they repeatedly refused to <a title="MSNBC - Avoiding attacking suspected terrorist mastermind" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4431601/">attack a suspected terrorist mastermind</a> even when there was an "airtight" case the Al Queda related cell was working on chemical weapons.</p>

<p>Abu Musab Zarqawi. a Jordanian militant, is now blamed for 700 deaths in Iraq and is still at large. We could have had him.</p>

<p>This is a perfect example of why I didn't favor the Iraq war. Bush & Co. were so busy with "their" war that they weren't fighting "our" war.</p>

	<h3>New York Donkeys don't like Bush</h3>
	
	<p>Being a New Yorker by birth, I follow the state's politics. According to a <a href="http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x10127.xml">Quinnipiac University poll</a> released yesterday, Bush is a sure loser in that state. </p>

<p>Even though Democrats out-register Republicans 5:3, GOP candidates are regularly elected state-wide. Republicans in the state had some hope Bush could pull off a win in the state based on his handling of 9-11. </p>

<p>But this poll sheds a lot of doubt. Of Democrats polled, 88 percent said they'd vote for John Kerry. That's not many Democrats for crossover voting.</p>

<p>Indeed, the president has very high negatives among Democrats. According to the poll, 6% admire the president, 14% are satisfied with his performance, 42 percent are dissatisfied and 35% are "angry" at the president. 43% of whites are "angry" and 41% of union households.</p>

<p>Apparently there are not many Reagan Democrats left in the state.</p>

		<h2>02.02.04</h2>
	

	
	<h3>Media finally admits it was wrong about Dean</h3>
	
	<p>Dianne Sawyer, one of the TV folks who played Dean's "scream" speech more than 700 times, has written an <a href "http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/news/wabc_2004vote_012904dean.html">article</a> which essentially said what I wrote a couple weeks ago. </p>

<p>She wrote in her analysis that Dean was yelling to be heard over a roaring crowd. Because of his special noise-cancelling microphone, TV viewers didn't hear the crowd and the cameras did not show the crowd either.</p>

<p>Journalism isn't a science and people make mistakes. I've certainly made mistakes in my time on the beat. But geesh, as an industry this one was bad. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the mea culpa is way too late. The damage is done. Millions saw the tapes. Thousands might see the clarification. </p>

<p>The Dean campaign made it's own mistakes. During Iowa, he lost his message. Their TV ads were mediocre and he should not have gotten into an attack war with Gephardt. But if the "scream" was reported fairly, with the "roaring" crowd putting it into context, Dean could have won New Hampshire.</p>

<p>I'll admit to being biased. Originally, I liked Kerry. But soon his campaign suffered from Gore syndrome-- over consulted. </p>

<p>Dean wasn't the perfect candidate. He definitely had the "doctor" arrogance. But once you understood that, the vibrancy he brought to the campaign was beyond imagine. It was exciting:<br />
<ul><li>Getting $40million from a huge number of small dollar donors. This in a party the Clintons got addicted to soft money to the point is didn't know how to raise hard money.</li> <br />
<li>Utilizing strategies originally used during the Civil Rights Movement to motivate and mobilize grassroots voters on the ground in New Hampshire.</li><br />
<li>Utilizing the Internet to coordinate huge numbers of supporters and for fundraising.</li><br />
<li>Getting the Democratic Party out of its shellshock to once again be the loyal (and patriotic) opposition.</li><br />
<li>Bringing issues such as realistic health care reform to the forefront.</li><br />
<li>Talking fiscal conservatism in an era when the president is breaking the bank with lopsided tax cuts and multi-billion dollar supplemental budgets.</li><br />
</ul><br />
For all these reasons and more, Dean is owed a huge thanks from Democrats (if not from the whole country). The other Democratic candidates are stealing his lines and the party in general has restored it's collective backbone. If the Democrats win in November. They have Dean to thank.</p>

<p>Want more proof of Dean's mark on the current political debate? </p>

<p>All of the sudden, with admitted encouragement from disgusted conservatives in his own party, the president is talking cutting the deficit in half in five years and is cutting back on many of his own proposals. Similarly, he's talking up his own health care initiatives. But that's another post.</p>

	<h3>As Bush quietly walks away</h3>
	
	<p>OK, maybe a long primary season isn't such a good idea. Here's an instance where I wish the Demos were not making headlines because this one should be splashed across page one.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/28/politics/28PREX.html?hp">Bush Backs Away From His Claims About Iraq Arms</a></p>

<p>I hope the 9/11 panel gets more time because there are a lot of questions that need honest answers. Then again, they probably wouldn't need more time if the White House hadn't stonewalled them to begin with.</p>

	<h3>Hoping for a nice long primary?</h3>
	
	<p>Well, Kerry has won two and the gang all heads south.</p>

<p>Some are hoping the Democrats can settle on a candidate early to rally around, but I just read an interesting viewpoint on the <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2004/1/28/15713/7367">Daily Kos</a> political blog. </p>

<p>"Kos" has assembled a very interesting set of correspondents for his blog and the comments, which can range into the hundreds, are generally well thought.</p>

<p>In a comment, "gttim" noted that as soon as the "race" for the nomination ends, the press coverage will die allowing Bush to get the upper hand in the media. </p>

<p>Thus, as long as there's a good primary battle going, there are several people constantly rattling the White House gates. That's definitely an upside to a long primary season. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the downside is bleeding the candidates campaign chests' dry just as they need cash to faceoff with the $200 million man.</p>

<p>But again, it will all be decided before I will have a say in the matter. Indiana's primary is May 4.</p>

	<h3>A rant about an alleged "rant"</h3>
	
	<p>Living in this "city 'neath the hills" we don't watch TV. When we moved here we didn't have money for cable and now we don't care.</p>

<p>Thus, for nearly a week now, I've been <i>reading</i> about how the Iowa "I have a screech" speech was "bizarre" and "damaging" to his campaign.</p>

<p>Finally, I searched for and found a video of <a href="http://webmastersforamerica.com/Idiom_Studio/Default.html">Dean's speech</a> on the net. </p>

<p>Darlene and I watched it together and looked at each other. Our reaction? With raised eyebrows we asked "<b>WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?</b>"</p>

<p>The video was taken by a person in the 3,000+ crowd. From their perspective the speech is fine. It makes perfect sense.</p>

<p>Dean had lost and he had a ballroom full of disappointed campaign workers. The experiment of asking people from around the country to show up and campaign had essentially failed. The numbers were there, but these folks were young and very inexperienced.</p>

<p>Secondly, you can tell he's losing his voice. Indeed, the media noted that just about every candidate was hoarse by the end.</p>

<p>Third, the place was a loud! He started talking, but you could hardly hear him. He had to yell to be heard over the crowd.</p>

<p>Watching it from their standpoint, it sounded like a rallying speech. Yes, he was passionate, but not unlike a football coach rallying his freshman squad.</p>

<p>As Judy Dean said, you could see it as maybe a "little silly," but that's it. </p>

<p>The reporters who covered the speech from the scene did a good job. But within a day the media fell into a pattern of rather pitiful coverage. I'm embarassed for the reporters who were sucked into this one. </p>

<p>Here's the <a href="http://www.cjr.org/blog/archives/cat_spin_buster.asp#000051%23more">Columbia Journalism Review's</a> take on the event.</p>

	<h3>Campaign journalists can occasionally be</h3>
	
	<p>Campaign journalists can occasionally be a bunch of seagulls. They fly after the same scraps, they sing the same song and can easily be lead away by someone with a morsel to eat.</p>

<p>In the process, they occasionally miss the story or make errors. BUT, reading, listening or watching the news, you wouldn't know it.</p>

<p>Coming to the rescue is the Columbia Journalism Review which created <a href="http://campaigndesk.org/">CampaignDesk.org</a> to track all this stuff-- everything from distortions and cheap shots to a tip of the hat to the reporters who are doing their job.</p>

<p>I've been a reporter and IT IS TOUGH!!!! I've made errors in political reporting that I wish I had not made. Nonetheless, I appreciate what CJR is doing and it's good reading for someone trying to understand the whole story of these elections.</p>

	<h3>Bush's approval rating drops from 60% to 50% - Immigration proposal falls flat�</h3>
	
	<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/17/opinion/polls/main593849.shtml">The latest CBS News/NY Times poll</a> has Bush taking a big drop in the latest approval polls to equal the lowest of his administration.</p>

<p>On one hand the constant polling of America drive me crazy because it makes it too easy for reporters to write "horse race" stories during an election year. </p>

<p>However, I find it interesting that his two latest "think big" initiatives are falling flat.</p>

<p>The proposed immigration policy appears to have hit a raw nerve. Several of our more conservative friends are mad as hornets over the proposal. Unfortunately I didn't get to talk to them long enough to find out why.</p>

<p>If the economy hadn't dumped 3 million jobs, I think people would be more open to his proposal. Even if the competition for jobs is more imagined than real, people are feeling defensive.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I agree the United States needs to rethink it's immigration policies. On a simple human rights basis, it's sad that people subject themselves to near death experiences to make it here.</p>

<p>Also, as much as I hate to say it, I agree with Bush that there are jobs people no longer want to take. </p>

<p>Why are there jobs Americans don't want? I think there are several elements at work. </p>

<p>First off, we're consuming more and more and wanting more and more services. </p>

<p>"Hello, welcome to Taco Bell, would you like to try our new bean, cheese and rice burrito today?"<br />
"No thank you, I'll take a 7-Layer Burrito please."<br />
"Would you like hot or mild sauce with that?<br />
"No thank you"<br />
"That'll be $1.73, please pull around"</p>

<p>In this scenario, the kid on the other side of the microphone knows there's 10 more jobs just like this one waiting for him if he wants to quit tomorrow. A couple of our friends who run restaurants have learned this one the hard way.</p>

<p>Then there is Walmart. </p>

<p>Walmart is getting us great prices. I admit that I find it hard to pay $4 for a box of cereal at Krogers when I know I can get the same box for $2.75 at Wally World. I just don't make enough to pay $4 for cereal.</p>

<p>Yet, there is a flip side to this. To give us great prices, Walmart is pushing down wages everywhere else. Not only what it pays its own employees, but also what it's willing to pay suppliers for goods.</p>

<p>The suppliers in turn, to make a profit, can't pay its employees all that much. For agriculture, this means immigrants. For manufacturing, it means going overseas.</p>

<p>Because neither the service economy jobs, nor the Walmart jobs pay diddly, people are less willing to take them -- unless they don't have the option.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we also know a lot people who don't have the option to turn down Walmart jobs as Madison does not have many well paying jobs either.</p>

<p>Again, if we hadn't lost so many jobs in the past couple of years, people wouldn't even think about these jobs. But today, I think they are.</p>

<p>But then there are the minority who believe they're the only true Americans and that immigration should be cut. I won't tell them that they're only the fourth-generation to live on our soil if you won't.</p>

<p>Personally, I like immigration. It keeps this country vibrant. We're getting a decent number of Latinos and Asians coming into town and I think it's exciting that our pleasent, though white bread, community is getting a little diversity.</p>

	<h3>Letter to Congressman Baron Hill�</h3>
	
	<p>Dear Sir,<br />
 <br />
 Our nation's space program definitely needs a new set of priorities to succeed in the 21st century. A shuttle replacement is a decade overdue and ISS has been a funding black hole.<br />
 <br />
 But cutting Hubbel in the process toward a manned trip to Mars grates my nerves. The Hubbel has done nothing short of revolutionizing astronomy and we should endeavor to keep it going until the new Webb telescope can take its place beside it. Combining the power of the two telescopes could exponentially increase the data.<br />
 <br />
 This alone would give us a much better understanding of our universe than a trip to Mars.<br />
 <br />
 You need to keep planning for manned space flight, but if Bush is only going to give NASA another $1 billion over five years, we'd get a lot more science out of robots. Instead we will be short changing every mission to gain enough money to get back to the moon. I can't imagine constructing a moon base would be cheaper then Alpha. I'd rather be visiting comets, asteroids and the planets.<br />
 <br />
 Thus I'm skeptical of the administration's motivations. When the president shoots for the moon, but gives you a budget for a vacation, something's wrong.<br />
 <br />
 sincerely,<br />
 <br />
 E.G. Yarnetsky<br />

	<h3>Butching up for Victory</h3>
	
	<p>A slightly bizarre article from The Nation that believes Dean is ahead of the Democratic pack because he's more <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20040126&s=goldstein&c=1">"butch"</a> then the rest of the gang. </p>

<p>The writer ponders whether the Republicans have substituted sex-roles for race in twisting Americans voting patterns. How does the cardiganed Carter compete against the he-man Reagan? He doesn't. Indeed, the author wonders if Bush's flight suit was padded to emphasize his he-man status.</p>

<p>Yet, it's also argued that his "Mission Accomplished" flight deck landing gives Dean points toward stating Bush is "All hat and no cattle."</p>

<p>Go figure...</p>

	<h3>Why am I not surprised?�</h3>
	
	<p>From day one, it felt like the 9-11 was more an excuse to invade Iraq than a reason. Why? Because before the war the reasons for invading kept changing. Afterward the invasion, the reasons kept changing. Now Bush even himself has told the press that "it doesn't matter" what the reason was.</p>

<p>Thus I found it not surprise when from former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill told former Wall St. Journal reporter Ron Suskind that <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/09/60minutes/main592330.shtml?cmp=EM8707">Bush sought a "way" to invade Iraq</a> from nearly day one of his administration.</p>

<h4>what.</h4>
<ul><li>This is a journal of our life, culture, libraries, the Apple Macintosh, progressive politics, and of course historic Madison, Indiana, the most beautiful rivertown in America.</li></ul>

<h4>who.</h4> 

<ul><li>G'day, I'm E.G. Yarnetsky and I answer questions at our local library. I'm preparing to go to grad school in January. I'm a former journalist who still dabbles in design work. My wife's a potter who makes beautiful functional and sculptural ceramics.</li></ul>
