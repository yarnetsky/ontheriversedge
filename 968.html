	<p>In the war against terrorism, President Bush has stated: &#8220;I think you can create conditions so that those who use terror as a tool are less acceptable in parts of the world.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I have a question, Mr. President. Why is using terror as a tool acceptable here in this part of the world? To the point, why have you not condemned the arrival of <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0409010148sep01,1,6705318.story?coll=chi-newsnationworld-hed">terrorists</a> who landed at an airport outside Miami last month to a homecoming celebration?</p>

	<p>If we as a nation really want to fight terrorism, if we as a nation really want to be the leader in this fight, we must do a few things.</p>

	<p>First, we must truly cooperate with other nations. No cop goes into the streets on his or on her own. Their back is always being watched by trained and able forces. Similarly, it is ideal when the officer knows the neighborhood is also watching his back. He needs to know he can do his job without fear the neighborhood will join in on the wrong side of the fight.</p>

	<p>That&#8217;s is why we need cooperation from other nations. Without it, we&#8217;re sitting ducks. That is why a coalition of the willing is not enough. If there is a weak link in the chainmail of our defense, the terrorists will find it. They are very mobile, very independent, can very easily take advantage of this weakness.</p>

	<p>Secondly, to get that cooperation, we must listen to the wisdom of former Texas Governor George W. Bush. During the second presidential debate in 2000 he stated: &#8220;If we&#8217;re an arrogant nation, they&#8217;ll resent us. If we&#8217;re a humble nation but strong, they&#8217;ll welcome us.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Indeed, we must not only fight the war against terrorism, but we must also take the moral high ground. To do this we must acknowledge that &#8220;a terrorist is a terrorist is a terrorist.&#8221; Not that &#8220;a terrorist is not a terrorist when he is a freedom fighter against a country whose leadership we would love to see overthrown.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Yes, this would make our foreign policy more difficult, but at the same time we would certainly start getting cooperation because no country could tell us we need to &#8220;practice what we preach.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Again, let&#8217;s start here at home. How can we as a nation argue against terrorism when we let a wanted terrorist slip our grips into the wilds of Honduras? How could we let his henchmen join in a celebration outside Miami?</p>

	<p>Could it be that we probably trained them to begin with? Could it be you&#8217;d rather win re-election rather than fight terrorism?</p>

	<p>[<b>Update</b>: this happened a couple of weeks ago, I just read about it on <a href="http://www.dailykos.com">DailyKos.com</a>. Here are two columns from foreign policy writers. The first from the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/commentary/la-op-sweig12sep12,1,2644811.story?coll=la-sunday-commentary">LA Times</a> and the second from the <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/opinion/sfl-08forum07sep11,0,5886862.story?coll=sfla-news-opinion">South Florida Sun-Sentinel</a>.]</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1217.html" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
