	<p><i>[<b>Note</b>: Darlene&#8217;s family in the Lima, Ohio, area was hit with an ice storm. She got a call into her family. It&#8217;s pretty bad up there, but I think I&#8217;d take this over a tsunami. The notion that 400,000 could be dead&#8212;I can&#8217;t comprehend. Either way, Darlene&#8217;s report&#8230;]</i></p>

	<p>Just heard from family up in Northwest Ohio.  We have been fussing here about the endless rain, but they got the ice storm last night.  At least 20,000 without power as of this morning.  Trees down, poles down, wires in the road.  Two counties up there have closed the roads completely.  Some of the branches my brother Stan saw had at least 2 inches of ice on them. My sister Sharon is out in the country.  Poles along her road for a mile or so are all down.  Was told it would be at least 3 days to restore power.  (Luckily my father has a generator and they were able to hook it up for her)  Sister Janie called me last night at about 10.  They moved last spring into the country outside of Bluffton, north of Lima, and trees surround their house.  They said their yard was full of big limbs and the crashing was continual.  Haven&#8217;t heard from her today.</p>

	<p>Both my brother Stan and my sister Rosalie said Lima looks like a war zone due to all the trees and poles down.  Stan drove across Lima last night and said up to 8 blocks in a row would be completely dark and that he kept having to detour around because so many city streets were blocked. Trees that are not down are losing limbs or bending wildly.</p>

	<p>Family friend who lives next to a woods says the crashing sounds kept him up all night.  When my brother went over this morning they could still hear endless crashing sounds in the woods.</p>

	<p>So I guess I will take the rain, although the Ohio river is rising very fast!</p>

	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
