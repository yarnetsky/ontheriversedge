	<p>As Darlene says &#8220;a water balloon is sounding really nice.&#8221; I&#8217;d prefer a rain storm personally.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>This is the first summer we&#8217;re observing Daylight Saving Time here in the Hoosier state and having not experienced the phenomena for more than a dozen years I must say that it is rather strange to have it light out after 9 p.m. However, I really like the extra hour of darkness in the morning and it postpones the heat of the day by an hour.</p>
	<p>Snippets from a hectic life here on the river&#8217;s edge&#8230;</p>
	<p>I just finished my first summer class last week and another class is starting up on July 1. In two dozen weeks I will be done.</p>
	<p>Our good friends Ellen and Hugh had a very good looking child yesterday&#8212;William Boyd at approx. 20&#8221; and 7.65lbs. Yes they&#8217;re weighing in decimals these days. This is the first time I saw a newborn when age was being counted in hours and not days or months. Meanwhille we&#8217;ve been watching William&#8217;s older sister on and off for the last few days as mom is in the hospital. Big sister is a good egg.</p>
	<p>Darlene has finally had a migraine-free day after what seems like a million day. We hope this functioning brain is a new trend.</p>
	<p>I added a new mascot to my repertoire. So far I&#8217;ve been Cat in the Hat, Froggy and now Curious George. Of course the minute I came into the library auditorium a kid starts crying. I admit that a 6-foot-4 monkey can be intimitating (the costume adds a few inches to my 6-foot frame). A parent told me afterward that the mom was telling the kid as she was dragging him from the room&#8230;&#8221;It&#8217;s just some guy in a costume, what are you so upset about.&#8221; Of course the library staff is now teasing me that I terrified a kid. sheesh&#8230;</p>
	<p>I&#8217;m going to have to shave off part of my beard for the first timie in more than a dozen years as I have to have a mole taken off my jaw. So now I&#8217;ll have to look at my chubby cheeks even more (they talk about the Freshman 15 I&#8217;ve gain the grad school 15)... oh well.</p>
	<p>Lobbying government can indeed work. Darlene and I along with a few others successfully lobbied city parks board to keep Crystal Beach Pool open in the evenings and I helped get a change in our county&#8217;s health policy. To bad I can&#8217;t get our reps and senators to listen to us.</p>
	<p>Later gaters&#8230;</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>For those who remember, I grew up in Buffalo, New York, home of chicken wings and the Buffalo Sabres.</p>
	<p>Of course it is the latter that is cheering me to no end at this moment. Behind a very promising young goaltender and a team of extremely dangerous nobodies, the Sabres are whipping on the Stanley Cup favorite Ottawa Senators.</p>
	<p>What makes the Sabres special is the way they play as a team. There is no single player you can keep in check because there are three to take his place.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, the only way I can follow the games is on the web. The <a href="http://www.buffalonews.com/sports/">Buffalo News</a> has been fun to read, though the <a href="http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=52588443-8f82-4c70-9052-d44464e5ecc1&#38;k=38005">Ottawa Citizen</a> has been equally fun:</p>
 <blockquote>It isn&#8217;t a playoff hole any more. It&#8217;s a crater. Three games down, and none left to lose.
	<p>Reach for those rare comeback examples, Senators fans, and grasp them, along with the family prayer beads, as Game 4 approaches tonight.</blockquote></p>
	<p>While I loved the 0-3 recovery by the Boston Red Sox&#8212;the Yankees are my least favorite team&#8212;it just will not happen for Ottawa, the Sabres are too good for that. </p>

<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/index.html?id=1209" title="Finally finished my semester"> Finally finished my semester</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>I&#8217;m exhausted, but I&#8217;m finished with the semester. It&#8217;s been so bizarre that I am truely excited to escape with a pair of A-minus grades. [update: on my last assignment I expected an A, but instead got an A+. That put me within 0.4 of an A so my prof rounded me up. I won&#8217;t argue.]</p>
	<p>Darlene&#8217;s still having a boat load of bad fatigue days and she ended up getting rabies shots afterall (it turned out there were too many dogs that looked alike). I&#8217;m still amazed that the week we had to search all over town for the dog I hardly had homework. Of course it piled on at the end of the semester like a tidal wave. To recuperate we&#8217;re taking the week off before I hit the books again next week.</p>
	<p>But to cap off a weird semester we had a weird weekend. </p>
	<p>First we were thinking of visiting the Lake Michigan coast and climb the sand bluffs, but it turned out our van needed brake work so we decided to skip the trip.</p>
	<p>Thus, last Monday we got the brakes fixed. On Friday, on the way to my last class in Indy, our brakes broke. We were pulling into Greensburg, Indiana, (home of a courthouse with a tree growing out of the clock tower) when we heard a horrible metal against metal sound. </p>
	<p>Amazingly there was a service station within a few hundred yards of where it happened. A good man looked at the brakes and found a bolt was improperly installed and it snapped. About 90 minutes later a better bolt was put in and he only charged us $35. I plan to go back to where I had it worked on and make sure everything is done right.</p>
	<p>Because of the time lost dealing with the brakes and then getting stuck in rush hour traffic on the way home, I ended up working on my final project until 1:15 a.m.</p>
	<p>The next morning we went to Louisville with friends and had a wonderful time. However, we came across an amazing phenomena&#8212;everything was closed because it was Derby Day. We wanted to go to <a href="http://www.hiddenhillnursery.com">Hidden Hill Nursery</a>, but the Hills were out of town as their kid was graduating (no problem there). Then we went to the Frankfort Ave. neighborhood expecting to hit all the little shops, but they were all closed. We went to other shops in the St. Mathews neighborhood and they were all closed. We went out to suburbia and all the independent stores were closed! It was amazing, we had stumbled upon Louisville&#8217;s official city holiday.</p>
	<p>Mind you, we went to a popular restaurant for dinner and we got right in because everyone was still at the Derby. As we were leavin the first sunburned Derby goers were just arriving.</p>
	<p>Today we slept and slept.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>Wow&#8230; I now live in a Nationall Historic Landmark! </p>
	<p>The acting secretary of the interior was in town yesterday to give our absolutely wonderful historic district an upgrade&#8230; I now live in the Downtown Madison National Historic <strong>Landmark</strong> District!</p>
	<p>Unlike Graceland, also named this year, we don&#8217;t have one house or one estate, we now have one of the nation&#8217;s largest (if not the largest) landmark districts with 144 blocks and 2,000 structures. With spring springing, this place is incredible. I&#8217;m so proud of this place and everyone who worked on this project. It is extremely well-deserved.</p>
	<p>Our friends, both of whom worked long and hard on the designation, were joking they are thinking of writting &#8220;Madison NHL, IN 47250&#8221; on their mail from now on.</p>
	<p>I&#8217;m heading off to a library conference today, so I can&#8217;t go into the wonderful details on how and why this honor, the highest in the nation, puts us on par with Savannah and Charleston. </p>
	<p>Nor will I take a whole lot of time explaining how (or wondering why) the acting secretary of the interior called our wonderful small homes &#8220;shotgun shanties.&#8221;</p>
	<p>I will leave you with <a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060412/NEWS02/604120451">the first of what I hope is many articles</a> about our community from today&#8217;s Louisville Courier-Journal.</p>

  	<p>Well, we think we found the dog. It was a nearly a week before we managed to see the dog so Darlene&#8217;s memory is now fuzzy and she cannot be sure. </p>
	<p>However, enough things fit together that our doctor believes Darlene doesn&#8217;t have to worry about rabies shots. One of the considerations is that our county has not had a case of domestical animal rabies in more than 16 years.</p>
	<p>So that&#8217;s good. </p>
	<p>I am hoping life will calm down for a while. Darlene needs a break and to be honest, so do I. I need time to jam for homework. With everything going on this semester, As are a lost cause, but I still hope to get a pair of A-minuses (as if that&#8217;s the end of the world ;0 )</p>
