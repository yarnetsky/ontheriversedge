<div class="entrytext">

	<p>I was recently emailing Greg (of <a href="http://www.openstacks.net/os">Open Stacks</a> blog-podcast fame) about movie soundtracks. From that email, lets follow a chain of casual connections&#8230;</p>

	<p>Neither of us have much affection for movie soundtracks. The beasts are often cobbled together spin-offs just to make more money. Heck, half the songs on the soundtrack can&#8217;t even be found on the film anymore.</p>

	<p>There are exceptions to the rule, often when the soundtrack transcends the film itself. The soundtrack to &#8220;Young Einstein,&#8221; is my favorite case in point.</p>

	<p>The movie was a super low budget comedy written, directed, produced and starring Australian actor <a href="http://www.yahooserious.com">Yahoo Serious</a>. It imagines Albert Einstein growing up as a Tasmanian, discovering his theory of relativity while brewing beer and romancing Marie Curie while trying to keep his theories from being used to make atomic bombs.</p>

	<p>Stopping to read reviews of the movie, I find myself wondering why I remember enjoying it. Hey, it was 15 years ago. However, a more likely reason is the soundtrack.</p>

	<p>While &#8220;Young Einstein&#8221; became one of the biggest films to come out of Australia and achieved some cult status, the soundtrack did even better selling more than 2 million copies. The album is chock full of cool Australian rock from groups like the Saints, Paul Kelly, Big Pig, Icehouse and the Lime Spiders. I listened to the cassette I don&#8217;t know how many times until it died from a case of sun stroke on the dashboard of our car.</p>

	<p>Similarly, I&#8217;ll admit that I can&#8217;t listen to Simple Minds&#8217; &#8220;Don&#8217;t You Forget About Me&#8221; without thinking about the movie &#8220;The Breakfast Club&#8221; (and on occasion the fact the movie was my first real date with my first high school love.)</p>

	<p>Thus through connections to life, soundtracks can chronical time as much as the movie itself.</p>

	<p>So, if you were a cyborg, would you have all the music of your lifetime stored in your brain so you could replay it like the soundtrack of your life?</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s arguable that us iPod owners, with anywhere from 512mb to 60gb of music at our fingertips, already have our life&#8217;s soundtrack at our fingertips and piping into our brains via white earbuds.</p>

	<p>Indeed, I&#8217;ve read complaints to that effect. Soundtracks play in the background of the film, sometimes, but rarely advancing the plotline. Critics claim iPods play nothing more than background music to life.  They argue that we really don&#8217;t enjoy music as it was intended (we shuffle instead of listening to albums straight through). We&#8217;re not reaching out for new musical experiences, creating playlists of our favorite songs (memories). To top it off, we&#8217;re not even listening to the real music as it&#8217;s stuffed with lossy 128mb MP3s&#8212;pixelated versions of the real uncompressed tracks. (Boy that sounds like a government conspiracy).</p>

	<p>But a tech marketing guru thinks it&#8217;s going beyond that. He argues that when we start using the iPods to store our files, our calendar reminders, our music and our contacts, it becomes an extension of ourselves. (What&#8217;s that phone number? let me check my iPod contacts list).  Thus what difference does it make if this extension is in our pocket or in our brains. We&#8217;re now cyborgs.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s an interesting argument. Read more: <a title="Wired News: My IPod, My Self" href="http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,66426,00.html?tw=rss.MAC">Wired My IPod, My Self</a> at Wired.com</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" href="http://www.ontheriversedge.com/index.php?id=1217" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
