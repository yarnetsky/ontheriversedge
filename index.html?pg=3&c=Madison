	<p>The river is now definitely out of its banks, fortunately we&#8217;re only looking at minor flooding here. While it&#8217;s covered our riverfront road and parklands, I&#8217;m hoping it stays out of the few houses that are down on the river front. They suffered enough in 1997.</p>

	<p>I posted a <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/egyarnetsky/PhotoAlbum5.html">new album of photos</a> Darlene and I took yesterday and today. When you check out the photos, take a look at the riverfront light posts. When the flood waters of 1997 crested, only the globe on top was above the water.</p>

	<p>For those who know Madison, the photo above is taken at dusk looking west from the <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?country=US&#38;addtohistory=&#38;formtype=address&#38;searchtype=address&#38;cat=&#38;address=Elm%20St%20%26%20W%20Vaughn%20Dr&#38;city=Madison&#38;state=IN&#38;zipcode=47250&#38;searchtab=home">foot of Elm Street</a> (three blocks south of our library). The walled area is the lower lawn of the Lanier Mansion.</p>

	<p>The river&#8217;s expected to crest tomorrow late morning. We&#8217;ll be out taking more photos. It&#8217;s odd to be gawkers. I guess it&#8217;s the old journalistic instincts to go out and cover the story.</p>

	<p>For &#8220;real&#8221; daily coverage, however, check the <a href="www.madisoncourier.com">The Madison Courier</a>.</p>

  	<p>Well, I guess the Midwest can&#8217;t get a snow storm and then days of rain without the Ohio River sending it all back our way.</p>

	<p>The National Weather Service&#8217;s <a href="http://www.crh.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ahps.cgi?LMK&#38;clfi3">Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service</a> is saying the Ohio River will likely top flood stage here in Madison Sunday morning. Here&#8217;s the graph&#8230;</p>

	<p><img alt="clfi3.gif" src="http://www.ontheriversedge.com/images/clfi3.gif" width="450" height="350" border="0" /></p>

	<p>I covered the last flood in 1997 extensively for <a href="http://www.madisoncourier.com">The Madison Courier</a>. I&#8217;m hoping there won&#8217;t be a repeat. Houses along Vaughn Drive (our river road) were flooded halfway up the first floor. The river hit 460.90 feet, the eighth worst recorded flood at Madison.</p>

	<p>It was amazingly scary to look inside the homes after being visited by the Ohio River. A half foot of river silt covered every surface from the floor to the sinks. The walls were laid bare half-way to the ceiling, the drywall disintegrated. We are so used to seeing the barriers, suddenly seeing straight through a house with only beams in the way is like looking at a ghost.</p>

	<p><b>Note</b>: The river crests are measured from sea level, not the bottom of the river. For comparison, the river bottom at Madison is at 403.2 or 402.3 (I can never remember which). It&#8217;s normal depth at this time of year would probably be about 420. I added the river stage under Madison links.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>Madison, Indiana, the most beautiful slush city in America.</p>

	<p>The &#8220;official&#8221; tally was 18-inches of snow in 24-hours. The total landed our county on the state&#8217;s emergency disaster aid list in the state. That might help pay the overtime of our diehard snow guys. They did an awesome job even working through Christmas, though they did take turns going home for periods to be with family.</p>

	<p>That subsequent freeze caused havoc on our town&#8217;s guttering. Buildings all across downtown had huge icicles hanging from the roof as the downspouts froze over.</p>

	<p>Across the street this morning, absolutely huge gutter-shaped chunks of ice came raining down on the sidewalk as the guttering collapsed.</p>

	<p>Another building had their windows cracked by cascading ice.</p>

	<p>At our library, a frozen downspout caused the melting snow and ice water to run down the side of the building and flooding into the children&#8217;s room. We got the books off the shelf largely in time, though we lost maybe 8 books. When I pulled one of the wet books off the shelf, it was entitled&#8212;&#8220;I Got Wet.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Go figure.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p><b>Editor&#8217;s note</b>: <i>This is an edited version of what Darlene wrote my mom. It stated our situation so perfectly that I got her permission to post it here. Here&#8217;s Darlene&#8230;</i></p>

	<p>Imagine our downtown where many of the residents do not have off street parking.  Now imagine 17 inches of snow dumped on that town in less than 48 hours&#8230;</p>

	<p>Jer and I returned this afternoon and I parked the van in the space we dug it out of.  As soon as I pulled all the way in, it occurred to me that getting back out could be a challenge.  Said parking space is still snow covered, a bit slippery, and the nose of the van is downhill a bit from the rear of the van.</p>

	<p>Out of sheer stubborness I decided I was going to try to get van out myself and pick Jerry up at 5.  Felt I should have practice in doing this sort of thing as you never know when you might need the skills.  Proceeded outside.</p>

	<p>Cardboard under wheels- no luck.  Moving van back and forth, no luck.  (only proceeded in moving to the far right side of the parking space) Hopped out of car to reposition cardboard.  Landed in 3 foot drift, slid out of drift to bounce on my kneecaps on the street. (3 points for humoring any onlookers at gas station). Repositioned cardboard, trudged back through snowdrift and tried again.  It is about 22 degrees outside and 2 kind boys on bikes volunteered to push. They were not very large, but quite insistent.  (a bit bored I suspect) No luck.  Man pulls up in truck, attaches chain to van and with boys pushing on other end I am freed!</p>

	<p>Slowly make my way across slush covered streets to library where I happily drop the problem in Jerry&#8217;s lap.  Ok hon, if we park in our space, we may not be able to get back out again.  Other spaces either have 4 foot drifts in them or cars covered in four foot drifts in them.  City lots are still snow covered.</p>

	<p>Head to nearest city parking lot.  Maybe it was more usable than it appeared.  Just before pulling in ran into friend Ellen who had just her own car freed from the snow.  Jerry proceeds cautiously into lot not realizing where Ellen had just been freed from!  Immediately get stuck in same mess that Ellen had just been pulled from in said parking lot.  Ellen&#8217;s husband and father in law and another friendly bystander along with Jerry proceed to push us out of drift and some kind (and probably exasperated) soul with a front loader plows a path to allow us to get out of the lot.</p>

	<p>So with no other parking opportunities, we were forced back to our same sloping parking space that we dug ourselves out of Thursday and will probably have to be pushed out of Tuesday afternoon.</p>

	<p>This is how we are managing the snow here in Madison. ( I am really glad we are not in Texas or Louisiana!)  I can&#8217;t wait to see what happens when businesses and the courthouse, city hall etc. reopen tomorrow.</p>

	<p>I asked for snow and so far I am still amused by it.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p><b>Planting the flag</b>: The pile of snow now in front of our shop is maybe five feet tall. We figured no one would see our sandwich sign that we were open today so Darlene climbed the snow mountain and planted our open flag on top. I&#8217;ll post a photo later.</p>

	<p><b>NekoBus unburied</b>: It took us more than an hour, but we managed to shovel our van out last night. We really have no desire to go anywhere, but I knew we wouldn&#8217;t want to tackle it with temps in the single digits if we had an emergency. It was parked close to the corner, but the city dozer (pictured in previous post) was nicer to us and didn&#8217;t dump any snow on us.</p>

	<p><b>Not so lucky on Main</b>: One of our friends is a shopkeep that lives above her store on Main Street. Yesterday, she unburied her car so she could get to work today. Overnight the snow plow buried her in again&#8212;five feet deep.</p>

	<p>According to Darlene, she was mad as a hornet this morning. &#8220;I&#8217;m sending a bill to the governor. There were only two cars on the block, they could have put the snow behind me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Knowing her luck the state, which plows Main Street, would probably say something like &#8220;a snow emergency means no cars on the street, parking included.&#8221; It doubt it wouldn&#8217;t mean anything to them that her nearest off street parking was two blocks away in a snow bound parking lot she couldn&#8217;t get into.</p>

	<p><b>No snowmen</b>: The snow is very heavy and a couple of my muscles were rather sore after shoveling. As heavy as it was, the stuff still too powdery. Darlene and I wanted to make a snowman infront of our shop, but it wouldn&#8217;t ball up. Mind you the creation would have been buried by the plow. Would that have been considered murder?</p>

	<p><b>Roundabout</b>: We heard from a customer that I-75 in Ohio is really slow going. The Ohio Dept. of Transportation website said much of it is snow covered and icy. Mind you, there are several variations of snow covered and icy. Is it, snowy but drivable or is it you&#8217;re crazy to try it snowy and ice covered?</p>

 Louisville didn&#8217;t get as much snow as we did, but they got a lot more ice and the roads are a mess.
