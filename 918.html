<div class="post">

<div class="entrytext">

	<p>Sometime this year we&#8217;ll probably buy a used vehicle. Doing a little research into the matter has led me to believe that may be a frustrating experience.</p>

	<p>Indeed, I&#8217;m starting to empathize a bit with John Kerry. The GOoPers wailed on him for saying he didn&#8217;t own an SUV, but that his family did. I&#8217;m actually starting to think I know how he feels.</p>

	<p>We own two vehicles&#8212;a minivan that definitely needs replaced and an ugly red Ford cargo van that we use to go to fine art festivals.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m extremely jealous of the jewelers who can shove their wares and display into a small station wagon. We, on the other hand, have at least 222 cubic feet of pots to haul in a van that gets 10 mpg in the city and 15 on the highway.</p>

	<p>I hate burning that much fuel to begin with, but it&#8217;s outright painful at $2 a gallon.</p>

	<p>We&#8217;ll probably keep the big van for shows, but something smaller for day-to-day use and taking pots to galleries.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;d like to get a station wagon that gets decent gas mileage.<br />
But Darlene, on the other hand, likes being able to get up off the road and see what&#8217;s going on around her.</p>

	<p>I can see her point of view. When I first started driving in my 76 Chevy Vega, I had a pretty good view of the road. Within the past 10 years it seems everyone has purchased an SUV or some other assorted monster truck. Now in order to get the same view of the road, you almost have to buy a monster yourself. It&#8217;s a mean cycle.</p>

	<p>Indeed, a couple of times recently we&#8217;ve driven borrowed or rented compact cars and the sight from down below is scary. Not only does it suddenly feel odd  to have my butt inches from the ground, but it&#8217;s scary to see the hubcaps of an SUVs roaring by. Hmmm, what chance does this Chevy Prism have against the Ford Expedition next to me?</p>

	<p>Mind you, there are cars coming out that suit both of our purposes. The Pontiac Vibe rides higher, has a bit of cargo space and gets decent mileage. Some of the smaller SUVs like the Santa Fe do OK in the mileage category as well. But alas, we don&#8217;t have $20,000 to buy either.</p>

	<p>So we&#8217;re back to square one. Either I have to suffice with 18 city/24 highway (admittedly better than 10/15) or Darlene has to sit closer to the ground while she&#8217;s driving.</p>

	<p>I think I&#8217;ve lost this bet and we&#8217;re looking at another minivan. At least we&#8217;ll be using the cargo space on a regular basis unlike many SUV drivers who occupy maybe 10% of the vehicle.</p>

	<p>Nonetheless I understand how John Kerry feels. I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;d love to drive a Prius, but his family wants to see the road. Obviously, he didn&#8217;t win his bet either.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1217.html" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
