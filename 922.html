<div class="post">

<div class="entrytext">

	<p>Thinking about it more, I believe all groups should be politically active. That&#8217;s the freedom we have. Organizations need to be able to flex the power of numbers.</p>

	<p>I think what I fear is majority tyranny.</p>

	<p>For example, the Republicans as the majority in the house have literally created and passed legislation without as much as a word from Democrats in the process.</p>

	<p>Then, when the Democrats try to slow down the process to get their two cents into the dollar being created, the Republicans hollar that the Democrats are trying to subvert the majority will. This is amplified by the Republicans&#8217; mantra of treason everytime someone disagrees with them.</p>

	<p>Frustrating, no?</p>

	<p>Conservatives by definition want to keep things they way they were (or for the cynical, keep things the way they thought they were). Yet, for better or worse, our country is changing. It&#8217;s multi-cultural and multi-religious and soon the &#8220;white man&#8221; will become a minority.</p>

	<p>In this kind of setting, majority tyranny is simply not a &#8220;good thing.&#8221;</p>

	<p>What does this have to do with church-state separation? Basically, a poltical party can bring with it a specific brand of religion that in turn can impinge on the freedom of other practices.</p>

	<p>As Thomas Jefferson wrote, &#8220;We hold these truths to be self evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&#8221;</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s hard to have the liberty to say your peace or to pursue one&#8217;s version of happiness, beit worshipping Christ, Allah or money when one group has the handle on every control and drop-kicks anyone who wants to suggest the boat is capsizing.</p>

	<p>To me this freedom needs to be spread around more than it is. Both to where Christians seeking power can exercise their beliefs in freedom and so those who don&#8217;t have the same beliefs can have the same freedoms.</p>

	<p>Schools need to be open to folks who practice their religion. Christian groups wants to meet after school on school property? So be it. Voluntary meetings around the flag pole for a prayer before school? Go for it. If a teacher wants to join in, fine.</p>

	<p>The key is that their practices should not impinge on the freedom of others to do the same. Thus the same teacher at the pole before school should not be leading the prayer in homeroom.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s not a matter of political correctness or &#8220;special rules&#8221; for minorities. Rather, it&#8217;s following the spirit of that Declaration, of following the Golden Rule and simply respecting your fellow human beings. Everyone should be made comfortable and welcomed as who they are.</p>

	<p>Thus, the majority can run the government, but they shouldn&#8217;t &#8220;rule&#8221; the country. That went out with King George III.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1217.html" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
