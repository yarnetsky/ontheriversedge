<div class="post">

<div class="entrytext">

	<p>Here&#8217;s a recent quote from Howard Dean&#8230;<br />
<blockquote><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2005/06/07/MNdean07.TMP">(Dean) said in San Francisco this week</a> that Republicans are &#8220;a pretty monolithic party. They all behave the same. They all look the same. It&#8217;s pretty much a white Christian party.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;The Republicans are not very friendly to different kinds of people,&#8221; Dean said Monday, responding to a question about diversity during a forum with minority leaders and journalists. &#8220;We&#8217;re more welcoming to different folks, because that&#8217;s the type of people we are. But that&#8217;s not enough. We do have to deliver on things: jobs and housing and business opportunities.&#8221;<br />
</blockquote></p>

	<p>In the past couple of days a number of Democratic elected officials and leaders have growled at Dean for the statement. In part because all that is being reported is that Dean said Republicans &#8220;are pretty much a white Christian party.&#8221;</p>

	<p>If Dean made a mistake here it was possibly leaving out the word &#8220;leadership&#8221; after Republican, because that&#8217;s who he&#8217;s talking about.</p>

	<p>Consider this. &#8220;Of the 3,643 Republicans serving in the state legislatures, <a href="http://americablog.blogspot.com/2005/06/oops-gop-really-is-all-white-study.html">only 44 are minorities</a>, or 1.2 percent.&#8221; White? Yes. Is the Christian right driving the Republican social policy? Yes.</p>

	<p>The truth is that the GOP is run by the Christian right on social issues and by corporate libertarians on economic issues. These people don&#8217;t want a &#8220;voice&#8221; in a democrary. They don&#8217;t even want to be the majority in a democracy. They want to rule&#8212;lock, stock and barrel.</p>

	<p>I give Dean tons of credit for trying to tell people we are heading toward a plutocratic theocracy&#8212;one that is oddly unChrist-like.</p>

	<p>Yet, we are in a time where this political truth telling can get your head chopped off by the GOP machine and the Democratic leadership is still clearly afraid of this buzz saw. If we can&#8217;t find a way of telling America the political truth of what we face, how can we possibly win in 2006 or ever?</p>

	<p>So to the Democratic leaders who are chewing on Dean I have this to say&#8230; if you don&#8217;t like hearing Dean tell the truth, you better figure a better way of doing it yourself.</p>

	<p><b>Afterword</b>: I did read an article that the D.C. Democratic gang is angry because Dean is ignoring the Democratic corporate fatcats when it comes to fundraising.</p>

	<p>Dean is actually doing an awesome job of raising money&#8212;we&#8217;re nearly doubling our off-year fundraising records (though Republicans are still outraising us 2:1). However, most of this money is being raised through small donations and, to make it worse (to insiders eyes), the money is being given to state parties.</p>

	<p>This is actually genius because it is at the state level that the Democrats are having the most luck and that can only ripple into the national ranks. Yet, the Washington establishment appears to be flinching at the notion and a few people are wondering if this isn&#8217;t a reason the establishment wants to take out Dean.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/index.html?id=1217" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>
