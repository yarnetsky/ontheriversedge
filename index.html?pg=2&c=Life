  	<p>My opportunity for futzing with my website is coming to an end. My online class starts Wednesday, Darlene has some appointments and sinus surgery coming up this week and I have class on Friday in Indy. Thus, no more futzing.</p>
	<p>Either way, my latest futz is a new photo page that falls within the template of the overall blog. Before the galleries were off site. I&#8217;m not <em>entirely</em> happy with the results, but it&#8217;s not bad. Creating the gallery is simple. The photos, on the other hand, take forever to prep. I&#8217;m just thinking there is an easier way of doing it.</p>
	<p>The first two galleries are from a recent weekend getaway to New Harmony, Indiana.</p>
	<p>So why are you still here? Go over to my new <a href="/?s=photos">photo page</a>.</p>

<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1221.html" title="Bloody brilliant!"> Bloody brilliant!</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>Well, classes ended for the summer last Saturday and since then I&#8217;ve watched more television than I have in the past year.</p>
	<p>I ordered the new <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/episodes/2005/">Doctor Who</a> season one for the library and have been previewing it. I&#8217;ll tell you right off that the show is bloody brilliant and we&#8217;re hooked.</p>
	<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/index.shtml">classic sci-fi show</a> was a staple on BBC from the 60s to the 80s. It was low budget camp, but affectionately good. They let it die a graceful death, but last year the BBC resurrect the series. I had heard that it was good&#8212;reruns have been showing on the <a href="http://www.scifi.com/doctorwho/">Sci-Fi Channel</a> But it is a lot better than I had expected. It&#8217;s close enough to the original that people will recognize the series, but it is so much better. It&#8217;s campy and humorous yet really great sci-fi. Highly recommended.</p>
	<h4>Equally brilliant&#8230;</h4>
	<p>...was Ned Lamont&#8217;s victory of Joe Lieberman. While I was glad to see Joe go down, there is more to the victory that I like. I like that candidates who are being outspent 2:1 and 3:1 are still winning. Jon Tester in Montana, Jim Webb in Virginia and now Ned Lamont in Conneticut all won against heavily financed opponents.</p>
	<p>Instead of winning through sheer expenditure of money they are winning by standing for something and organizing real people at the grassroots level. </p>
	<p>America needs to keeps its collective eye on this trend as it could corrupt our <em>current</em> system of government. It&#8217;s really beginning to smack of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/al16.html">a government of the people, by the people and for the people</a>. </p>
	<p>It&#8217;s truly a subversive concept.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>The GOP just amazes me. They&#8217;re always wanting clean up or down votes on their issues, but they won&#8217;t give 15 million American workers a clean up or down vote on the minimum wage.</p>
	<p>No, instead they say <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/07/28/national/w130835D66.DTL&#38;type=politics">we&#8217;ll give you a couple of bucks in minimum wage, but only if you give multi-millionaires <strong>yet another</strong> juicy tax break</a> that will cost the nation $800 billion over the next decade when we are already drowning in red ink. </p>
	<p>Really graceful guys.</p>
	<p>Mind you, I&#8217;m not much more graceful today. </p>
	<p>It&#8217;s hard to describe, but I mount my bicycle on a moving start. Today, however, I didn&#8217;t realize the chain had come off and when I went to step on the peddle the bike offered no resistance or forward movement. Thus I flipped over the bike into the street just as an 18-wheeler was coming through the intersection.</p>
	<p>Other than a scraped knee and feeling sore I&#8217;m fine, but a truck (even one that is moving slowly as he saw me flip) is scary looking from asphalt level.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>(From Darlene&#8230;)</p>
	<p>Just a little over a week ago, I held our friends&#8217; newborn son in my arms.  He was less than two hours old.  Proud Mom and Dad and seven year old sister all beaming happily.  What a wonderfully cheering day that was! </p>
	<p>Today the family narrowly avoided a tragedy.  Our friend Hugh, the proud father, was working security for the local hydroplane race here &#8211; the Madison Regatta.  Stationed at the Jefferson Street gate, he was just three feet from the the car that came screaming through the crowd and into the Ohio river.  </p>
	<p>As I searched for him along the riverfront today all I could think of was that little bundle in my arms not long ago, and that family that needs him. Hugh was there, right in the midst of it all. I hardly looked at the accident scene as I was led past it, so focused as I was at locating Hugh, so I could tell his wife he was safe.  And Hugh was overwhelmed by the event as so many were.  He saw it all and it was brutal.</p>
	<p>I am thanking God for this family that is safely home together tonight. Others were not so fortunate and may our prayers be with them.</p>

  	<p>It&#8217;s <a href="http://www.madisonregatta.com">Regatta time</a> here in Madison. It&#8217;s a time when partying seems to escape the usual Friday-Saturday night block.</p>
	<p>Thursday features a battle of the bands on the riverfront and people loiter for hours thereafter. I have no real problem with it really, every town deserves to party. I just wish it was quiet enough on our corner to sleep.</p>
	<p>As Darlene says &#8220;a water balloon is sounding really nice.&#8221; I&#8217;d prefer a rain storm personally.</p>

<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1212.html" title="It&#39;s summer..."> It&#39;s summer...</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>This is the first summer we&#8217;re observing Daylight Saving Time here in the Hoosier state and having not experienced the phenomena for more than a dozen years I must say that it is rather strange to have it light out after 9 p.m. However, I really like the extra hour of darkness in the morning and it postpones the heat of the day by an hour.</p>
	<p>Snippets from a hectic life here on the river&#8217;s edge&#8230;</p>
	<p>I just finished my first summer class last week and another class is starting up on July 1. In two dozen weeks I will be done.</p>
	<p>Our good friends Ellen and Hugh had a very good looking child yesterday&#8212;William Boyd at approx. 20&#8221; and 7.65lbs. Yes they&#8217;re weighing in decimals these days. This is the first time I saw a newborn when age was being counted in hours and not days or months. Meanwhille we&#8217;ve been watching William&#8217;s older sister on and off for the last few days as mom is in the hospital. Big sister is a good egg.</p>
	<p>Darlene has finally had a migraine-free day after what seems like a million day. We hope this functioning brain is a new trend.</p>
	<p>I added a new mascot to my repertoire. So far I&#8217;ve been Cat in the Hat, Froggy and now Curious George. Of course the minute I came into the library auditorium a kid starts crying. I admit that a 6-foot-4 monkey can be intimitating (the costume adds a few inches to my 6-foot frame). A parent told me afterward that the mom was telling the kid as she was dragging him from the room&#8230;&#8221;It&#8217;s just some guy in a costume, what are you so upset about.&#8221; Of course the library staff is now teasing me that I terrified a kid. sheesh&#8230;</p>
	<p>I&#8217;m going to have to shave off part of my beard for the first timie in more than a dozen years as I have to have a mole taken off my jaw. So now I&#8217;ll have to look at my chubby cheeks even more (they talk about the Freshman 15 I&#8217;ve gain the grad school 15)... oh well.</p>
	<p>Lobbying government can indeed work. Darlene and I along with a few others successfully lobbied city parks board to keep Crystal Beach Pool open in the evenings and I helped get a change in our county&#8217;s health policy. To bad I can&#8217;t get our reps and senators to listen to us.</p>
	<p>Later gaters&#8230;</p>
