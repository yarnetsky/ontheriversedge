<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1085.html" title="I&#8217;m scritchin a Tiger between the ears"> I&#8217;m scritchin a Tiger between the ears</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>This morning I starred at the ring of fire and leaped through to Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve been playing with it on and off all a day and it is one sweet cat. I get an educational discount so Tiger only ran me $70, but I&#8217;m thinking I&#8217;d be happy if I did have to pay $130. Here&#8217;s my experience so far&#8230;</p>

	<p><b>Installation</b>: Installation was mostly painless though I did decent amount of preparation to avoid trouble. Here&#8217;s what I did&#8230;</p>

	<p>I backed up my user folders, my applications and libraries. At that point I ran out of space on my iPod. I used Onyx to repair permissions, cleared cache and ran the maintenance scripts. Then I ran DiskWarrior and repaired the directories. I double checked whether I needed any new firmware.</p>

	<p>Then I bit the bullet and installed Tiger. I was mildly surprised that the default setup simply upgrades the system. You have to chose &#8220;options&#8221; to choose either an &#8220;archive and install&#8221; or &#8220;erase and install.&#8221; I chose &#8220;archive and install&#8221; as it gave me a clean new system folder while still porting over my old settings. The whole process from there was maybe 30 minutes tops.</p>

	<p>A few things didn&#8217;t work off the bat. Norton&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t work and Virtual PC needs an minor upgrade. If you go to the <a href="http://www.macintouch.com/tigerreview/">Macintouch</a> website, you&#8217;ll find a full review including a software compatibility chart. It reported that there were a few security problems and asked if I wanted to fix them. I did, but I honestly don&#8217;t know what it meant. Even so, the shakeout time was minimal.</p>

	<p><b>It&#8217;s a speedy cat</b>: Once Spotlight, Tiger&#8217;s new system searching software, finished indexed my hard drive the speed differences became evident. It sounds odd, but everything simply does what it should when it should. There&#8217;s no lag time. &#8220;Crisp&#8221; is a good word.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m using a Powerbook G4 1.33ghz computer so it&#8217;s reasonably quick, but under 10.3 it still slugged along occasionally. That&#8217;s no longer the case. The difference between 10.3 and 10.4 is very noticable.</p>

	<p>Apps are faster as well. The new versions of Safari and Mail pack some speed improvements, but I was astounded by the speed change in Firefox. It seems to pull down pages in an instant. iPhoto 5 is a lightyear better than iPhoto 4 under 10.3. The iTunes Music Store downloads pages in a flash under Tiger. All in all, it truly feels like I have high-speed Internet now.</p>

	<p><b>Visually interesting</b>: The new video technologies in this build are impressive. The interface can ripple and wave with no apparent hit to the performance. The new Quicktime 7 is beautiful. Quicktime videos have a polish I simply did not expect&#8212;they are crystal clear. If you have a widescreen powerbook or monitor, the QT7 features HD capabilities that will blow you away.</p>

	<p>Mind you, there are portions of the interface that I&#8217;d almost call ugly, Mail 2.0 for example. Hey you can&#8217;t win them all.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>When I started grad school I figured I&#8217;d never again have an opportunity to purchase affordable software so I purchased about everything that made sense. Mind you, I&#8217;ve been so busy I haven&#8217;t had time to use any of it.</p>

	<p>However, tonight I did and so help me, it put Windows XP on my wonderful Apple PowerBook G4&#8230;. aaarrrgggghhh&#8230; I feel so dirty.</p>

	<p>A friend and fellow Mac user brought over some CDs that for some reason could not be read on a Mac. He couldn&#8217;t read them and I couldn&#8217;t read them. So for the first time, I used Virtual PC and fired up Windows XP. Low and behold, I could read the discs.</p>

	<p>I use Windows at work so that wasn&#8217;t a big deal, but it took me a good hour to figure out how Virtual PC worked so I find the files and burn him a new disk on the Mac side of things.</p>

	<p>Maybe there&#8217;s a lesson in all this. Maybe it shows that sometimes you have to compromise yourself in order to attain the greater good. Even though I may hate it, I now know I can run Windows on my laptop if it means helping a friend. Is this what it&#8217;s like to co-sponsor legislation with a Republican? <strong>wink</strong></p>

<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1047.html" title="Soundtracks, iPods and Cyborgs"> Soundtracks, iPods and Cyborgs</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>I was recently emailing Greg (of <a href="http://www.openstacks.net/os">Open Stacks</a> blog-podcast fame) about movie soundtracks. From that email, lets follow a chain of casual connections&#8230;</p>

	<p>Neither of us have much affection for movie soundtracks. The beasts are often cobbled together spin-offs just to make more money. Heck, half the songs on the soundtrack can&#8217;t even be found on the film anymore.</p>

	<p>There are exceptions to the rule, often when the soundtrack transcends the film itself. The soundtrack to &#8220;Young Einstein,&#8221; is my favorite case in point.</p>

	<p>The movie was a super low budget comedy written, directed, produced and starring Australian actor <a href="http://www.yahooserious.com">Yahoo Serious</a>. It imagines Albert Einstein growing up as a Tasmanian, discovering his theory of relativity while brewing beer and romancing Marie Curie while trying to keep his theories from being used to make atomic bombs.</p>

	<p>Stopping to read reviews of the movie, I find myself wondering why I remember enjoying it. Hey, it was 15 years ago. However, a more likely reason is the soundtrack.</p>

	<p>While &#8220;Young Einstein&#8221; became one of the biggest films to come out of Australia and achieved some cult status, the soundtrack did even better selling more than 2 million copies. The album is chock full of cool Australian rock from groups like the Saints, Paul Kelly, Big Pig, Icehouse and the Lime Spiders. I listened to the cassette I don&#8217;t know how many times until it died from a case of sun stroke on the dashboard of our car.</p>

	<p>Similarly, I&#8217;ll admit that I can&#8217;t listen to Simple Minds&#8217; &#8220;Don&#8217;t You Forget About Me&#8221; without thinking about the movie &#8220;The Breakfast Club&#8221; (and on occasion the fact the movie was my first real date with my first high school love.)</p>

	<p>Thus through connections to life, soundtracks can chronical time as much as the movie itself.</p>

	<p>So, if you were a cyborg, would you have all the music of your lifetime stored in your brain so you could replay it like the soundtrack of your life?</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s arguable that us iPod owners, with anywhere from 512mb to 60gb of music at our fingertips, already have our life&#8217;s soundtrack at our fingertips and piping into our brains via white earbuds.</p>

	<p>Indeed, I&#8217;ve read complaints to that effect. Soundtracks play in the background of the film, sometimes, but rarely advancing the plotline. Critics claim iPods play nothing more than background music to life.  They argue that we really don&#8217;t enjoy music as it was intended (we shuffle instead of listening to albums straight through). We&#8217;re not reaching out for new musical experiences, creating playlists of our favorite songs (memories). To top it off, we&#8217;re not even listening to the real music as it&#8217;s stuffed with lossy 128mb MP3s&#8212;pixelated versions of the real uncompressed tracks. (Boy that sounds like a government conspiracy).</p>

	<p>But a tech marketing guru thinks it&#8217;s going beyond that. He argues that when we start using the iPods to store our files, our calendar reminders, our music and our contacts, it becomes an extension of ourselves. (What&#8217;s that phone number? let me check my iPod contacts list).  Thus what difference does it make if this extension is in our pocket or in our brains. We&#8217;re now cyborgs.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s an interesting argument. Read more: <a title="Wired News: My IPod, My Self" href="http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,66426,00.html?tw=rss.MAC">Wired My IPod, My Self</a> at Wired.com</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>Every year about this time, Mac Addicts around the world start dreaming and drooling over what Steve Jobs might announce during the MacWorld Conference Keynote.</p>

	<p>Well this morning was the morning and I&#8217;m really rather impressed with the results.</p>

	<p>Here are what I consider the highlights:</p>

	<p>They finally have the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle">$99 iPod</a> everyone want. It&#8217;s called the iPod Shuffle. It&#8217;s the size of a pack of gum. An elegant white pack of gum. No screen to pick out the tunes, rather you program a playlist through iTunes and load it up. You can either have it loop the list or shuffle the list at random. You can even use it as a flash drive. 512mb for $99 or 1gb for $149.</p>

	<p>An interesting new word processing-design program called <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/pages/">Pages</a>. Pages is a mid-range product. It won&#8217;t take the place of Quark XPress or Microsoft Word, but it looks like it can do the basics rather well. Lots of control over style and type. It also has term paper basics like footnotes and tables of contents. Best of all, it incorporates basic page design such as call-out boxes, photos and columns. I&#8217;m hoping everyone who&#8217;s the editor of a club newsletter gets their hands on a copy. Because it&#8217;s loaded with some pretty decent templates, even the worst Pages document would look better than what most of the junk created on a PC using Microsoft Publisher.</p>

	<p>But probably what everyone was waiting for was the announcement of an awesome low-end computer&#8212;the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini">Mac Mini</a> for $499.</p>

	<p>You need to add a monitor, keyboard and mouse, but it&#8217;ll take any standard accessory so you could get easily buy a decent setup for under $700. I&#8217;m noticing rebates for free keyboards and mouse at the online warehouses.</p>

	<p>Apparently with an adapter you can even plug the Mac Mini into a television or stereo and it can be turned into an entertainment center for playing movie, looking at photo slideshows or listening to music.</p>

	<p>Adding wirless and things like that will run up the cost a bit, but still it&#8217;s a good deal.</p>

	<p>The kicker? This puppy is small&#8212;the size of a stack of CD cases 2 inches thick!</p>

	<p>There&#8217;s a lot, lot more! Those were just my three favs. For more details check out <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple&#8217;s</a> website for details or <a href="http://www.macsurfer.com">MacSurfer</a> for a collection of headlines and commentary.</p>

<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1035.html" title="On blogging and blog reading"> On blogging and blog reading</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>After &#8220;retiring&#8221; from journalism, I started this blog in 2003 as a way to get myself writing again. It&#8217;s an easy way for friends and family to keep up with us and over the past year, for better or worse, it has also evolved into a personal soap box.</p>

	<p>About once every six weeks I check the site statistics and every time the numbers have astounded me. I guess everyone who blogs wants to be read, but why have readers visited my blog <i>thousands</i> of times in 2004?</p>

	<p>I visit blogs because they have something worthwhile to read. I like it when a writer manages to think outside the box and write something beyond the &#8220;echo chamber.&#8221; When you read news, blogs and commentary on a regular basis, coming up with something unique is truly a challenge. Thus when it happens it&#8217;s definitely worth reading. While my writing isn&#8217;t horrible, I can&#8217;t imagine more than a 10 of my 300 entries reaching that pinacle.</p>

	<p>I suspect if I specialized on writing one topic, it would be easier to create good content. On the flip side, specialization takes a greater level of research, you cannot blog off the cuff as I always do. Nothing will kill a good entry faster than the lack of time or lack of motivation. I&#8217;ve lost count of the issues I have not written about due to the lack of one or the other.</p>

	<p>Either way, with my writing and the possible interest people might have in it causes me to expect maybe 20 visits a day. Yet, I&#8217;m now averaging 250 a day. I realize a chunk are from search engines and another large chunk are from robots looking to deposit comment spam, but still why are the numbers growing?<br />
Are these numbers high for an off the cuff blog or is this pretty average or even low?</p>

	<p><blockquote>Jan: 815 &#8211; Feb: 2,070 &#8211; March: 2,401 &#8211; April: 2,207 &#8211; May: 3,651 &#8211; June: 3,372 &#8211; July: 4,762 &#8211; Aug: 4,305 &#8211; Sept: 4,716 &#8211; Oct: 6,463 &#8211; Nov: 7,080 &#8211; Dec: 10,591.</blockquote></p>

	<p>Meanwhile, nothing will change here much as I&#8217;ll be starting grad school in a week. I&#8217;m excited and ready to go.</p>

  	<p>It&#8217;s well known that word of mouth can really help or kill a business, but what happens when your fans start doing advertising for you?</p>

	<p>Wired News take a look at a <a title="Wired News: Home-Brew IPod Ad Opens Eyes" href="http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,66001,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_2">&#8220;Home-Brew IPod Ad&#8221;</a> that is doing just that.</p>

	<p>I watched it a couple times, it is easily one of the best ads I&#8217;ve seen in a while. Take that with a grain of salt considering I don&#8217;t watch television. Nonetheless, it is pretty cool.</p>

	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>
