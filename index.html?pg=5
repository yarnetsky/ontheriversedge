  	<p>My poor Darlene. She&#8217;s had a rather rough past year with fatigue, migraines and more. Well we finally got some news that after all the tests she&#8217;s been through one finally showed a positive&#8230; hypothyroidism. That&#8217;s something that&#8217;s very treatable so we&#8217;re happy.</p>
	<p>HOWEVER&#8230;</p>
	<p>Saturday night she was <a href="http://www.madisoncourier.com/main.asp?Search=1&#38;ArticleID=29432&#38;SectionID=4&#38;SubSectionID=&#38;S=1">bitten by a dog in the arm.</a>. </p>
	<p>The bite itself was not horrible&#8212;bad brusing, a good scrape and a shallow puncture wound. Her jacket protected her from the worst of it.</p>
	<p>However, unless we can find the dog, she faces a round of painful and very expensive series of rabies shots (first one alone is $1,000). So far we have not found the <code>#^#$%&#38;</code> dog.</p>
	<p>She&#8217;s spent the last few days walking around looking for the dog and she is absolutely exhausted. She recognized the dog so she is hoping she can find it again.</p>
	<p>I&#8217;m going to go out and do some searching this evening. In the meantime, the dog catcher finally came off of being sick and fielded calls all day today from people because the paper ran <a href="http://www.madisoncourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=4&#38;SubSectionID=253&#38;ArticleID=29457&#38;TM=63686.6">another article</a> in today&#8217;s paper as well.</p>
	<p>We have two candidates. One everyone knows, but believes to be basically friendly. Darlene will take a look at that dog tomorrow. There&#8217;s another that has been reported to terrorize small animals, but we can&#8217;t find that dog.</p>
	<p>Wish us luck!</p>

  	<p>It seems about this time each semester my brain freezes and says it&#8217;s time for the next semester. I really should have chosen an grad school that does quarters, 16 weeks is just too long. Then again everyone told me it would be a marathon so who am I to complain now. In just over a month I&#8217;ll be 2/3 of the way toward my MLS.</p>
	<p>I think my mistake was making plans for between semesters. My last class is over on Friday, May 5, and I start summer classes Friday, May 12. Over the short break Darlene and I decided to hit the beach. Mind you, we may be wearing sweats instead of swim suits as we&#8217;re thinking of visiting the western Michigan shore. </p>
	<p>Our friends are telling us it&#8217;ll be cold up there. Our favorite southern belle is telling us to hit the gulf coast instead. &#8220;Brown sand, yuck! Visit the sugah beaches.&#8221; But I&#8217;m remembering the last time we went and were able to climb huge sand dunes. </p>
	<p>We&#8217;ve been known to change our minds. A few Octobers ago, after visiting my mom in Buffalo, we had planned to camp in the Finger Lakes. We got there we heard the lows would dip into the 20s&#8230; so we headed south to the Delaware shore.</p>
	<p>Mind you, I still think it&#8217;ll be a pretty time of year to go to Michigan. Holland will be having their annual <a href="http://www.tuliptime.com">Tulip Time Festival</a> which is apparently one of the largest flower festivals in the country.</p>
	<p>Sigh&#8230; I need to quit dreaming of sand dunes and think about my homework again&#8230; </p>

<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/index.html?id=1203" title="The unexpected history of church- state separation"> The unexpected history of church- state separation</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>Washington Monthly has a fascinating article in their April issue on the <a href=""http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2006/0604.waldman.html">early history of church-state separation</a>.</p>
	<p>Just as we are debating church-state separation today, it was heavily debated in the early years of our country. Because the &#8220;Founding Fathers&#8221; were truly split on the issue, Waldman wrote that both sides of the current debate could easily point to them for support.</p>
	<p>However, there is a very interesting kicker to this history. Those who favored church-state seperation (Jefferson and Madison interestingly) had an unusual ally&#8212;evangelical Baptists.</p>
	<p>The Baptists of the 18th century were staunchly against any government involvement in religion. This was both from their theology and because they were persecuted at the hands of the majority religions&#8212;the Anglicans and Congressionalists who favored state supported religion.</p>
	<p>Religions do and are certainly welcome to change their beliefs. It is nice to see religions no longer condoning slavery, for example. However, it is interesting that today&#8217;s biggest proponents of breaking down the church-state walls were of the same religion who fought to build the walls to begin with.</p>

<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/index.html?id=1202" title="An Old Possum&#39;s Podcast of Practical Cats"> An Old Possum&#39;s Podcast of Practical Cats</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>I just finished a homework assignment to create a &#8220;booktalk&#8221; for a juvenile or young adult poetry. I chose &#8220;The Old Possum&#8217;s Book of Practical Cats,&#8221; which is one of my childhood favorites.</p>
	<p>After I wrote the script, I decided to have a little fun and recorded it using a cheapy microphone and Appleâ€™s GarageBand program. The process was fun and relatively easy. </p>
	<p>The result is an audio file that comes in at 3 minutes flat. I&#8217;d call it a podcast, but if I understand correctly, a true podcast is downloadable via RSS 2.0.</p>
	<p>Either way, if you have iTunes, you might try <a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/yarnetsky/oldpossumsbook.m4a">this link to the AAC version</a> which comes in at 1.5mb:</p>
	<p>Otherwise, <a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/yarnetsky/oldpossumsbook.mp3">here is the link to the mp3 file</a> which is 3.4mb.</p>
	<p>I figure a school media specialist can go into the classroom and throw out a couple booktalks to a captive audience. However, public libraries do not usuallly have that advantage. Thus in the 21st century we have to  go where the kids are. I imagine kids, armed with mp3 players, just might be convinced to download the latest booktalks if we do a good enough job.</p>
	<p>On my first attempt here I doubt mine would make the cut for some kid&#8217;s iPod, but in general we can always hope.</p>

  	<p>I have been amazed with the response to our brand new <a href="http://www.mjcpl.org">library website</a>. </p>
	<p>Right out of the gate, people flooded us with purchase requests and questions. That is good.</p>
	<p>Yet, a bunch of people kept asking the same question, how to log into their account. So it finally dawned on me to see if I had correctly written the instructions. So I went to the page describing how to use the system and&#8230;. (no surprise here)... the link was dead. aarrrgggghhh! So I fixed the link and I have not received the question again. Hey, you learn. You squash bugs and you learn.</p>
	<p>I also learned about the extra line feeds Windows puts into text documents. Our web forms are driven by a perl script. Once I started receiving the boatload of mail from the site I realized I forgot to change the subject lines on the various versions. Thus the purchase requests, the ILL requests and the reference questions all looked the same. I went in to change the script and and Windows inserted extra line feeds. The scripts failed as a result and type 500 server errors were flying everywhere. Fortunately, Thursdays our tech guru comes to visit and showed me how to fix the problem. Thankfully, the fix was easy.</p>
	<p>Meanwhile, the website received a <a href="http://www.madisoncourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=4&#38;SubSectionID=253&#38;ArticleID=29071&#38;TM=67284.48">front page article in our local paper</a>. (Finally, I&#8217;m on the front page for something other than our historic district board of review). I also received an interesting mention from Thomson-Peterson&#8217;s <a href="http://syndicateblog.petersons.com/wordpress/index.html/links-for-2006-03-14/">Syndication for Higher Ed</a> blog.</p>
	<p>A library director from up river asked my director is she could hire me to do their website (too bad I can&#8217;t right now, that&#8217;s be fun). </p>
	<p>Meanwhile, I took a peak at our <a href="http://www.mjcpl.org/index.html?id=157">bee naming contest</a> results and it is indeed going to be a tight race.</p>

  	<p>Last semester, as part of my Information Architecture class, I had to create a website for a &#8220;real client.&#8221; </p>
	<p>Well yesterday, that project became a &#8220;real website&#8221; and is now serving the library where I work. There is still alot of work, but I&#8217;m really happy with how it is turning out.</p>
	<p>Check it out over at <a href="http://www.mjcpl.org">www.mjcpl.org</a> and let me know what you think. Constructive criticism is very welcome.</p>
	<p>The website will also give me some serious writing duties on our new blog <a href="http://www.mjcpl.org/?s=Library-Buzz">Library Buzz</a>. There are a number of entries, but I&#8217;m still getting my sea legs with it. We&#8217;ll have library news and staff and patron reviews, but beyond that I&#8217;m still working it out. If anyone out there does a public library blog, let me know what all you include.</p>
	<p>While you&#8217;re over at the site, feel free to vote in our library bee mascot naming contest. We held the first phase of the contest last month when we asked for name suggestions. We received more than 200 entries. The staff and director narrowed the list to six names and now everyone can vote. The finalists are Booker Bee, Libbee, Booksbee, Billie Bee, Bee A. Reader and Readmore.</p>
	<p>Some  day once the contest is over, I hope to get permission to publish the entire list because some of them are really wonderful, but didn&#8217;t make the cut for various reasons.</p>

  	<p>Take a gander over at <a href="http://www.valleycityblues.com">Valley City Blues</a> a new progressive political blog some friends and I are working on. </p>
	<p>We&#8217;re thinking of straight ahead political commentary on local, state, national and world politics, history and more.  There are four of us, three have posted at least once so far. It will be interesting if we can get it going and attract some good honest conversation.</p>
	<p>I&#8217;ve cross-blogged my last few entries, but may give up political blogging here and work on it over there. I&#8217;m not sure.</p>
	<p>If you&#8217;re in or very near Jefferson County, Indiana, and would like to blog, let me know. For example, we&#8217;d love to have people to track the state and congressional races coming up. I&#8217;d love to do it (my journalistic blood still bubbles on occasion), but I just don&#8217;t have the time to do it this year.</p>
