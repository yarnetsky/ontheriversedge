	<p>Darlene and I were debating with a conservative friend about Social Security the other night. Yes, we have a number of conservative friends&#8212;they like us anyway.</p>

	<p>The jist is we agree Social Security was technically in trouble as the baby boomers greatly outnumber us Gen Xers. (Yes, I am among the oldest of the slacker generation). How do we solve that problem and keep social security solvent? Pay into it but forfeit our retirement? That&#8217;s what it looks like so far as they figure it&#8217;ll be broke by the time I&#8217;m ready to retire.</p>

	<p>The Republican option, as little as I&#8217;ve read about it so far, is to allow us younger pups to put money aside into dedicated retirement funds we could invest in the markets.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;d like to hear more on possible solutions as it&#8217;s obvious something needs to happen, but so far I see two problems with this solution.</p>

	<p>First, in order to liberate the younger folks&#8217; money into these accounts, the government would have to borrow tanker loads of money. The problem is who will pay this debt? The same generations the solution is supposed to serve. I see this as a break even proposition at best. As it is, we are falling seriously in debt due to the tax cuts for the baby boomers. (Hey, after race wars and class wars, isn&#8217;t the age wars next?)</p>

	<p>Second, the markets can be awesome for growing nest eggs, my grandfather has some success in that category, but there is significant risk. If it crashes when you are getting ready to retire, you can be screwed for years.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m seeing this now in the library world. There is a generation of librarians that were about to retire causing a well publicized and anticipated shortage (thus jobs for me). However, many of these good folks are delaying that decision because they lost a chunk of their 401K accounts in the tech bubble burst. Now must work an extra number of years.</p>

	<p>This post came about when I read today that librarians are not the only ones having problems with the markets. Apparently, our beloved Republican Senate Majority Leader Dr. Bill Frist lost <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26558-2004Dec1.html">nearly a half-million dollars</a> in campaign funds on the market in the last few years.</p>

	<p>Finally, one more thought just hit me. When a government contractor (Halliburton) can&#8217;t figure out what happened to a third of the money that was supposed to be used for Iraqi reconstruction and troop support, who do we trust to invest our money? Will the investment bankers be getting a free pass to abuse our accounts or will there be checks and balances built into the system?</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/index.html?id=1217" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
