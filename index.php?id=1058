	<p>My wife is addicted to her daily dose of <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/user/Bill%20in%20Portland%20Maine">Cheers and Jeers</a> at Dailykos.com.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Bill in Portland Maine&#8221; does a fine job of bringing a smile to my darlin&#8217;s face. However, sometimes it&#8217;s the comments that follow that get her rolling on the floor. Here is one comment that did the trick today&#8230; it seems so aprapo being a former journalist&#8230;.</p>

	<p><blockquote>This test only has one question, but it&#8217;s a very important one.  Please don&#8217;t answer it without giving it some serious thought. By giving an honest answer you will discover where you  stand morally. The test features an unlikely, completely fictional situation, in which you will have to make a decision.</p>

	<p>You&#8217;re in Florida&#8230;In Miami, to be exact&#8230; There is chaos around you, caused by a  hurricane and severe floods. This is a flood of major proportions. You are a photojournalist  working for a major newspaper caught in the middle of this great disaster. The situation is  nearly hopeless.</p>

 You&#8217;re trying to shoot  career-making photos. There are houses and people swirling around you, some disappearing under  the water. Nature is  showing all its&#8217; destructive fury. You see a man in the water. He is fighting for his life, trying not to be taken away with the water and debris. You move closer.

	<p>Somehow the man looks familiar. Suddenly, you know who it is&#8230; it&#8217;s George W. Bush! At the same time you notice  that the raging waters are about to take him  under, forever. You have two options. You can save him or you can take the  most dramatic photos of your life. You can save the life of George W.  Bush, or you can shoot a Pulitzer Prize-winning photo, documenting the death of one of the world&#8217;s most powerful men.</p>

 Now, here&#8217;s the  question (and please give an honest answer):

 Would you select color film, or rather go with the classic simplicity of black and  white?</blockquote>

	<p>Darlene was reading me this one out loud and I was about to say save him because I didn&#8217;t want Cheney as president. Of course, that was before Darlene told me the punchline.</p>

	<p>I remember one time saying I hated Bush. He was lying through his teeth about one thing or another and I was mad as a hornet. But I&#8217;m getting better about that kind of thing. I&#8217;m studying to be a librarian and it is basically in our ethics that we&#8217;ll serve anyone. I&#8217;d even help Karl Rove research whether Hillary Clinton is really an alien from a planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse.</p>

	<p>Actually it was from today&#8217;s Cheers and Jeers that Bill in Portland stated my thoughts about Bush well:</p>

	<p><blockquote>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really hate George W. Bush.  I just think the President of the United States ought to be able to pass a 5th-grade social studies test.  And not break everything he touches.  And not throw the tax dollars I give him down a sinkhole of debt.  And not toss me and my partner into the snapping jaws of the Bible-thumpers.  And not hire media whores.  And not require loyalty oaths.  And not lie.  And not lie.  And not lie&#8230;&#8221;<br />
&#8212;-Bill in Portland Maine.</blockquote></p>

	<p>I personally don&#8217;t blame Bill and his partner Michael for being fearful of &#8220;Bible-thumpers.&#8221; Our society has become rather less respectful of fellow human beings. I truly do not believe Jesus would treat gays as lepers, especially considering how well he treated lepers to begin with. Fortunately, most people I know don&#8217;t thump their Bibles, but rather read the Good Book with care.</p>

	<p><b>Update</b>: Darlene found another tidbit in today&#8217;s Cheers and Jeers.</p>

	<p><blockquote>CHEERS To HATE, as in &#8220;I hate that m* f* George W. Bush and all that he stands for, and I hate his entire administration, and all of his supporters, and all of his apologists.  And oh yeah, I also hate the Republican party. Because I know what they are all about: stealing from the poor to give to the rich, and bigotry and hypocrisy and lies lies lies.&#8221;</p>

	<p>JEERS To HATE, as in &#8220;I hate people of different races, creeds, classes and orientations.  Because I never bothered to find out what they are all about and since they are different than me, they must be evil.&#8221;</p>

	<p>There are two different flavors of hate: blind and justified.</p>

	<p>by Billy Shears on Wed Feb 16th, 2005 at 10:06:03 PST</blockquote></p>

	<p>Interesting.</p>

	<p>If you&#8217;re curious, the <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/2/16/105234/586">whole thread</a> on hate started when a columnist called Dailykos something akin to a seething pot of hate toward Bush and Republicans.</p>

	<p>Keep in mind that Dailykos does not believe in censors. It&#8217;s not raunchy, but the &#8220;f&#8221; word flies around.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/index.php?id=1217" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
