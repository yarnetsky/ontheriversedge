	<p>My collection development professor wasn&#8217;t planning on writing many comments on a draft document we turned in last Friday&#8230; that was until she saw an &#8220;it&#8217;s&#8221; that should have been an &#8220;its.&#8221; Seeing that the &#8220;dam broke loose,&#8221; she said, and the comments were flowing. Of course, yours truly had to be one of the offenders.</p>

	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m surprised that you, having been a journalist, would make that error.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;What can I say, I had copy editors.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Between you and me, I&#8217;m amazed my writing has been as clean as it has been lately.</p>

	<p>It wasn&#8217;t a beautiful afternoon, but it certainly wasn&#8217;t the cold, windy Fridays of recent weeks. Thus I went for a walk and, for the first time ever, visited the Indiana State Library and the Indiana Capitol.</p>

	<p>Both buildings have been recently renovated and both are absolutely beautiful and do the state proud.</p>

	<p>I walked around the capitol extensively peering in at the Indiana Supreme Court and the house and senate chambers. I stood in the office where former Madison Mayor Morris Wooden sat as state auditor. I even visited the governor&#8217;s office.</p>

	<p>I knew the governor wasn&#8217;t there. Indeed, he was here in Madison while I was there in Indianapolis.</p>

	<p>Nonetheless I gave the person at the desk in his office my three cents.</p>

	<p>Penny one: The governor comparing the minority Democrats, who had walked out on the legislative session, to terrorists &#8220;car-bombing&#8221; his &#8220;drive toward reform&#8221; was pretty darn tacky when our troops are in Iraq suffering from the real &#8220;car bombs.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Penny two: I noted that complaining about it was hypocritical when the Republicans had done the same type things to Democratic administrations. As a classmate of mine stated: &#8220;same practices, just the sides have changed.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Penny three: I did say that I liked the idea of daylight savings time.</p>

	<p>See I can be bi-partisan.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" href="http://www.ontheriversedge.com/index.php?id=1217" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
