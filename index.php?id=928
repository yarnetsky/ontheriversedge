	<p>I finally read The Da Vinci Code during vacation after everyone and their brother told me to read it. After that kind of buzz I expected a lot so on the whole I came away a little disappointed.</p>

	<p>The concepts and history interpretations he presented were rather interesting and I loved the puzzles. Yet, as literature it wasn&#8217;t very good.</p>

	<p>It read like a mystery novel wrapped around an academic paper. It used the &#8220;cliffhanger&#8221; device way too often, author Dan Brown didn&#8217;t realistically develop the characters and the dialog seemed to exist solely as a way to convey information about his research. Overall it came off as bit sloppy to me.</p>

	<p>I started reading it while we were at the Leeper Park Art Fair in South Bend. An English teacher came up and said it was one of her 10 favorite books of all time, but that she was mad at the author because she was a Christian.</p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t know why an English teacher would consider it one of her top 10, but I&#8217;m not surprised it made her mad. Unfortunately, the conversation ended before it really got started so I&#8217;m not sure what part of the book made her mad&#8212;Jesus as human, the &#8220;edited&#8221; Bible, how the early church adapted and pilaged the existing religions, goddess worship, etc., etc. I guess any could do the trick.</p>

	<p>It didn&#8217;t really make me &#8220;mad&#8221; per se. I think part of the reason is I never took the Bible as absolute truth (though it does contain absolute truths). Like Brown, I suspect that books like the Bible don&#8217;t make it through time unedited. Recent translations have made true efforts to return to the earliest copies, but where are other reports of Jesus&#8217; life? Just as Fox News bypasses news of President Bush&#8217;s foibles, I suspect we&#8217;re missing details of Jusus&#8217; truly astounding life.</p>

	<p>That&#8217;s the end of my thoughts as of now. I&#8217;m still thinking.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" href="http://www.ontheriversedge.com/index.php?id=1217" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
