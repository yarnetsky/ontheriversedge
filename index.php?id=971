	<p>Well, I did it and I survived. I took the GRE this afternoon and did well enough that I&#8217;m not embarrassed to report my scores to the Indiana University School of Library and Information Science.</p>

	<p>I didn&#8217;t do as well on my verbal as I had on a couple of my practice tests, but based on estimates (I&#8217;ll know exact percentiles in a few weeks) I still managed to get into the top 15%.</p>

	<p>The quantitative I&#8217;m happy with. I beat my practice scores and even beat the national average by 30 points. Considering my math skills had deteriorated significantly prior to studying, I&#8217;m satisfied.</p>

	<p>I believe I did well on the analytic writing essays as well, but I won&#8217;t learn those scores for a few weeks either.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m also happy with my scores considering I woke up at 3 a.m. and couldn&#8217;t get back to sleep for Lord knows how long. (Our alarm clock was on the blitz because some guy broke in to the transformer station and <a href="http://www.madisoncourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=4&#38;SubSectionID=253&#38;ArticleID=20097">turned off the power to downtown</a> last night&#8230;bizarre story). Then we got off to Louisville a later than I wanted and I had to skip lunch. Fortunately, Darlene had the foresight to bring a bottle of water, a banana and a snack bag of Cheezits for me to munch on. It was just enough to get me through.</p>

	<p>I sat down at the computer and, after a few minutes of mild panic, the rest of the test went fine. I&#8217;m amazed at how focused I was able to get when it counted. Mind you when I was done, the adrenaline rush came to a crash and I was nearly shaking.</p>

	<p>While I was taking the test, Darlene enjoyed some shopping for the first time in an eon and bought me a very classy forest green sweater as a &#8220;congratulations for surviving&#8221; gift. We kicked back Louisville for a little bit, had seafood for dinner and walked around a bookstore and health food store (I got hooked on almond butter and that&#8217;s the only place I can find it). After all that I finally was able to wind down a bit.</p>

	<p>But I did it, I&#8217;m done and I&#8217;m ready to crash for the night.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/index.html?id=1217" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
