  	<p>...Sometimes I wonder if <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/gallery/tv2/marvin.shtml">Marvin the Paranoid Android</a> had it right.</p>
	<p>This morning I had a dream I was on the phone arguing with the electric company over a $128,000 bill. &#8220;But I&#8217;m a librarian I only make xxx dollars a year!&#8221; (as if it would do any good explaining that.) They were charging me $60,000 because they were closing the Madison office of all things.</p>
	<p>I finally got mad (or madder rather) and hung up. I was panicking because I was running really late for work. I finally got to work and as I walked in my director said she needed to speak to me.</p>
	<p>At that moment the phone rang.  I woke up and realized I was indeed 30 minutes late for work as I had forgotten to turn on the alarm clock. I listened to the answering machine and it was a bill collector.</p>
	<p>I can understand dreaming about being late for work, but should I really be anticipating the call of a bill collector?</p>
	<p>That said, life has interceded and I admit I have not felt the urge to blog for the past few weeks. Basically, as Walt Crawford noted: <a href="http://cites.boisestate.edu/v5i13a.htm">Life Trumps Blogging</a></p>
	<p><strong>Life&#8230; not necessarily in this order&#8230;</strong></p>
	<p>1. My better half hasn&#8217;t been feeling well the last few months and we&#8217;re trying to figure out how to get her back to her usual self. She&#8217;s going on her fourth specialist so far with no diagnosis. It was a bill collector for the hospital that called this morning. They&#8217;re helping us try to figure out what we actually owe them as their billing system sucks.</p>
	<p>2. Life is hectic at the library and I&#8217;m trying to avoid the feeling of drowning because I took off time to be with Darlene (I&#8217;m slowly catching up again&#8230; I think).</p>
	<p>3. Classes started up again. I&#8217;m taking &#8220;Materials for children and young adults&#8221; and &#8220;Evaluation of Library Sources and Services.&#8221; Because of parts one and two (specifically part one), I&#8217;m not quite into the spirit of non-stop studying though the classes are interesting. Nonetheless, my 4.0 will most likely bite the dust this semester. I know that&#8217;s not really a bad thing as very, very, very few people ever care or check. Nonetheless, the concept is taking me a little bit of effort to accept.</p>
	<p>4. My mom got me <a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1164.html">this amazing book</a> for my birthday (39 on 2-10) and it is sitting there taunting me to read it, but I really do need to read more of my homework. I&#8217;ve read many books already for the kiddie lit class (really good stuff!)</p>
	<p>Something will get me writing again. I&#8217;m sure George Bush is plotting his next stupid human trick right now just to get me blogging. Then again, some days there is so much stupidity that I give up trying to keep up with it all.</p>
	<p>Until then&#8230; toodaloo caribou</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>I can&#8217;t believe this year has gone by so fast. One of my cohorts at my library does a fun Christmas poem summarizing the year at the library and asked me if I had any recollections that would make for good poem fodder. I sat there and realized I couldn&#8217;t remember a single thing at that moment. Then again, the past month has been insane. Between annotated bibliographies and websites, I&#8217;m ready for a break.</p>

	<p>I had my last class on Saturday and I&#8217;m now half-way toward my MLS.  18 credits down, 18 to go. I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;ll be off for a month before starting my second year of grad school. I&#8217;ll even take a vacation in January before classes start up again.</p>

	<p>I have plenty of things to do over the month&#8212;cleaning house, weatherization (well overdue) and applying for a scholarship. Right now though, I&#8217;m reading a mystery novel (William Tapply&#8217;s &#8220;Nervous Water&#8221;)&#8212;ah the luxury. </p>

	<p>The Christmas poem is read at our annual staff Christmas dinner which was a lot of fun. For gift swap my director pulled my name and I received a gift certificate to our new <a href="http://www.localharvestmarket.com">Local Harvest Market</a> which is a really neat grocery specializing in gourmet and organic foodstuffs. </p>

	<p>I went a few days later and decided to eat things I&#8217;ve never had before. The first was sushi. Apparently California rolls, made from rice, seaweed, crab and cucumber, are the &#8220;gateway&#8221; sushi. I guess people understand crab better than raw fish. I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d like it, but it was absolutely delicious, though wasabi will undoubtedly be an acquired taste. Oddly, the other think I experimented with was pumpkin seeds.</p>

	<p>When sushi is exciting you know I&#8217;ve been living a boring life of late&#8212;homework, homework and homework. Oh well. Maybe I&#8217;ll do something or think of something worth blogging. </p>

<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1167.html" title="Only on a Saturday night in Madison"> Only on a Saturday night in Madison</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>Tonight was one of those &#8220;only in a small town&#8221; episodes&#8230;</p>

	<p>Our bedroom is right over the intersection so we hear all kinds of traffic and people walking outside our building. As a result we always run some sort of white noise to provide a bit of tranquility to our evenings.</p>

	<p>Tonight was odd though. At about 10:30 p.m. we started to hear stomping, clapping and laughing. Darlene and I looked at each other our eyes saying &#8220;what the&#8230;&#8221;</p>

	<p>After a minute of the racket it hit me. </p>

	<p>When I got home today from campus our little friend Lilli was drawing on our sidewalks with chalk. It&#8217;s her favorite pastime as her parents visit us at the studio downstairs. I wasn&#8217;t quite sure, but I would have bet that Lilli, being the cute six-year-old she is, drew a hopscotch board on our sidewalk. </p>

	<p>Of course, I made Darlene guess and when she got it her look went from annoyance to one of mischief.</p>

	<p>We both peeked out our front window and lo-and-behold a bunch of 20-something guys, probably walking between bars, were playing hopscotch and cheering each other on.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;m not sure what the official international rules to hopscotch are, but I&#8217;m pretty sure you have to lean over and pick up the stone,&#8221; one of the guys said. The next guy proceeded to play by the rules.</p>

	<p>By this time Darlene had snagged our digital camera, we just had to get this episode shot for posterity.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>Our friends, who have three kids and a mother moving in, just bought a bigger house (no surprise there). They are now trying to get the place ready to move in which is taking quite a bit of work.</p>

	<p>One of the things they are doing is totally redoing the kitchen, tearing everything out and starting over from scratch. Hearing this we said &#8220;hmmm&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

	<p>As a result, we bought all their old cabinets, their refrigerator, sink, dishwasher and double oven. It wasn&#8217;t a bad deal.</p>

	<p>Last night and today we yanked them all out, dragged them over to our place, hauled them up to the third floor where they will sit until sometime next year when we have the ability to abandon our kitchen for the two weeks it&#8217;ll take to redo our kitchen.</p>

	<p>At least we get to use our &#8220;new&#8221; refrigerator until then. It&#8217;s the first refrigerator we&#8217;ve ever &#8220;owned.&#8221; We&#8217;ve been borrowing an extra from a friend and before that everywhere we lived came with a frige. </p>

	<p>Is there some phrase to the effect.. &#8220;you know you&#8217;re married when&#8230;&#8221; ? It took us 15 years, but hey.</p>

<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1161.html" title="Information architecture and my brain"> Information architecture and my brain</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>My information architecture class has been taking my brain power of late. Indeed, I haven&#8217;t thought about much besides that.</p>

	<p>The class requires me to create a website for a &#8220;real&#8221; client. Of course, when I mentioned this to my library director I was offered  the opportunity to redesign our library&#8217;s website. Even though we are a smaller library I find this to be a plum assignment so I&#8217;m grabbing it.</p>

	<p>That said, trying to get a handle on how to structure such a large amount of content and still allow for room to grow is pretty mind boggling. Then you have to create an interface that allows people to readily find the information they desire. Even something as seemingly simple as labels can be tricky. </p>

	<p>For example, take what we call &#8220;pathfinders.&#8221; These are a combination of bibliography and cheat sheet on particular topics. They could include book titles, topic shelf numbers (741.5 is my favorite Dewey Decimal number), recommended search phrases for our catalog, recommended websites, et al. </p>

	<p>However, other than librarians, who would instantly understand what a pathfinder is. I worked at a library for months before I realized what one was. So what do you call it? An information guide? subject guide? cheat sheet? There are no accepted terms really. Nonetheless, the key is for people to find them and use them.</p>

	<p>The bottom line is you really have to empathize with the person doing the searching or surfing and test the living daylights out of the site to see how other people use it.</p>

	<p>To top that off, I am trying to figure out how to use the <a href="http://www.textpattern.com">Textpattern</a> content management system to handle the site. It&#8217;s very nice software, but it can only handle a certain breadth of content. For example, my &#8220;Read &#38; Relax&#8221; pages would have topics categorized by genre and item material. No problem. However, the pathfinders would be categorized by subject area. The kids page, in turn, would then be sorted by genre and reading level. As a result, I have come to realize that I am really designing a half dozen websites under the umbrella of the library masthead. </p>

	<p>If you would like to be in my testing group, send me an email and tell me just a little about yourself and what you use library websites for. I&#8217;d appreciate the feedback. If you live in our fair Jefferson County, Indiana, all the better!</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>Well Saturday I went to the Apple Store in Indianapolis with my dead 4G 40gb iPod in hand.</p>

	<p>I signed up to speak with the Genius Bar genius, then shared the gospel of the Mac with my nephew who had tagged along for the ride.  While he played with the Mac mini, I scoped out the iPod nano which is indeed impossibly thin by the way. </p>

	<p>The place was packed, but there was a good ratio of staff to perusers. My nephew, being a Linux fiend, of course asked if he could run his favorite flavor of Linux on a Mac. Yes, he could, the Mac guy said, but why bother with Linux when Mac OSX is based on UNIX as well. He still wanted his Linux. I probably could have conned him into it, but the staff had wisely cut off access to the terminal.</p>

	<p>Finally, my turn came and I handed the genius the iPod telling him to put the iPod to his ear. He heard the whirrr and clunk and immediately said&#8230;&#8221;Yep, it&#8217;s the hard drive. Let me check your warrenty information and get you a new one.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Within minutes I had a new iPod in hand. Actually, I suspect it was more like a reconditioned iPod, but who am I to argue.</p>

	<p>While I wish my iPod didn&#8217;t die to begin with, at least getting it replaced was quick and painless.</p>

	<p>When we got home, my nephew proceeded to commandeer my Powerbook and created a DVD of his sister&#8217;s basketball game video. I think I may make him a convert yet.</p>

	<p>Darlene&#8217;s packing for the <a href="http://www.madisonchautauqua.com">Madison Chautauqua</a>, the big art show that&#8217;s here in Madison this weekend. There was an article in the local monthly newspaper about her, but unfortunately it&#8217;s not available on the web.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m busy with an information architecture course which starts with learning how to hand code websites. This is my <a href="http://library.ontheriversedge.com">projects</a> page if you&#8217;re interested. The only projects I&#8217;ve done so far that are interesting are ones about Darlene making pots and a website evaluation of the <a href="http://www.aucklandcitylibraries.com">Auckland City Libraries</a> website.</p>
