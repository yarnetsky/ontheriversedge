	<p>I was in the back hall waiting for my cue. The sounds from the library auditorium echoed of sqeals and laughter. If it wasn&#8217;t so happy sounding, I&#8217;d wonder if a riot was taking place.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Lord, help me out here.&#8221; I beseeched as I wondered what I got myself into. I had volunteered to be the Cat in the Hat for a Cat in the Hat Party.</p>

	<p>I had taken photos of a Clifford party where &#8220;Clifford&#8221; interacted with 20 or so kids. I can deal with that. As the party date approached, I learned they had signed up 40 kids.</p>

	<p>When I walked into the auditorium, there were no 40 kids there. The place was absolutely packed. &#8220;Hmmm, I&#8217;m supposed to read Cat in the Hat to this crowd?&#8221;</p>

	<p>We played it just like the book. The librarian had to go get some craft materials so &#8220;the mom&#8221; wasn&#8217;t home when the cat arrived. I came in promising fun. We did &#8220;The Cat Says&#8221; did a Conga line and a pair of Thing One and Thing Two dolls &#8220;body surfed&#8221; through the crowd.</p>

	<p>I was out of things to do when I was finally rescued by the Librarian &#8220;coming home&#8221; and she asked me to read them the book.</p>

	<p>I sat down among the crowd and used my loudest voice to read the story. For the most part they paid good attention.</p>

	<p>From there the evening was a blur. I noticed things were a bit off kilter when a bunch of kids said they didn&#8217;t get the craft project. Didn&#8217;t get one??? We punted and gave away the gifts and cookies. Hey they even gave me a yo-yo too!</p>

	<p>Afterwards as we were cleaning up, I had kids hug me, a couple Japanese kids danced the cat dance with me and had my picture taken with kids which was fun. I got down on my knees as this 7-foot-tall cat would tower over the 4-foot-tall kids.</p>

	<p>Then I heard the kicker. One of our volunteers did a count as they were hearing a story. We had 76 kids show up for the party and that didn&#8217;t include the umpteen toddlers who came with their parents (or the parents themselves). We had well over 100 folks in the auditorium.</p>

	<p>Suffice it to say, I&#8217;m not sure I would have done it if I knew I&#8217;d be the Cat for more than 100 as opposed to my assumed 20. But it worked and I had a lot of fun. What can I say, I am enough of a ham to pull it off.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve always been a character. Now I know I can be a character.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1217.html" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
