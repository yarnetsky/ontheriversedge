<strong>note</strong>: a post from my wife. I need to get her a blog.

	<p>From the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4204754.stm">mouth of our president:</a></p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees. They did appreciate a serious storm but these levees got breached and as a result much of New Orleans is flooded and now we&#8217;re having to deal with it and will.&#8221;</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>He hasn&#8217;t a clue, does he???  His administration was responsible for cutting funds that were being used to continue upgrading those levees!  It was all over the news last week that a hurricane hitting New Orleans could ruin the levees!  Jer and I read a big expose about what would happen in New Orleans if a major hurricane hit, that the (New Orleans) Times-Picayune published over a year ago!  </p>

	<p>And he didn&#8217;t cut his vacation short until Tuesday to deal with the situation, though he was out campaigning for his social security program on Monday.  Why isn&#8217;t the full force of our military down there?  We have a city of a half a million covered in floodwaters with more than 30,000 trapped!  Hello????  </p>

	<p>And he is fussing over looting.  If I were poor with no transportation, no food, no water, and trapped in a flooded city for 3 days already, I might be a little angry as well!  And certainly would break into places for food and water and whatever else needed.  As for the other looting, I think we are seeing a lot of angry people that believe they have been abandoned and who can blame them?  I would be angry enough to destroy things too if I were in that position! </p>

	<p>Yes some people stayed out of pure stubborness or disbelief.  However, many of the ones who stayed were poor.  Many had no vehicles, and those who did often turned back when they couldn&#8217;t find gas stations that had fuel!  Many were tourists whose flights had been cancelled. And the first comments about using the superdome said that they were taking elderly and ill people first.  Yes buses did take people to the superdome, but how many buses?  And the people were told to bring their own food ect.  Now imagine a family with no vehicle, walking with their children and supplies through the rain to catch a bus to a place that they are not even sure they are going to be admitted.  No wonder some of them stayed put!  </p>

	<p>Okay, that&#8217;s my rant.  I don&#8217;t blame everything on Bush, but his lack of knowledge of the situation is appalling. We need better leadership than this.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/index.html?id=1217" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
