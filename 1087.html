	<p><blockquote>C reported on his recent talks in Washington. There was a perceptible shift in attitude. Military action was now seen as inevitable. Bush wanted to remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy. The NSC had no patience with the UN route, and no enthusiasm for publishing material on the Iraqi regime&#8217;s record. There was little discussion in Washington of the aftermath after military action.</blockquote></p>

	<p><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1593607,00.html">&#8212;From the secret Downing St. memo. 23 July 2002</a></p>

	<p>Since the runup to Iraq War there were complaints about the intelligence being cherry picked to pave the way toward war.</p>

	<p>Casual indications said they were right. The Niger yellowcake story fell apart. The former treasury secretary reporting that Bushies were planning war against Iraq within weeks of Inauguration. U.S. government confirmation that there were no weapons of mass destruction.</p>

	<p>Finally, on 1 May 2005 The Times of London dropped  a bombshell in the form of a secret British memo (linked above) by a foreign Blair foreign policy aide.</p>

	<p>The memo, minutes from a high-level British policy meeting, stated that evidence for war was being fixed.  Amazing isn&#8217;t it?</p>

	<p>The story was huge internationally, but until today it seemed only the Knight-Ridder papers had picked up on the story.</p>

	<p>Today, in response to 89 Democratic house members demanding an explanation did CNN <a title="CNN.com - Bush asked to explain UK war memo - May 11, 2005" href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/05/11/britain.war.memo/index.html">finally cover the story</a>&#8212;10 days later. Indeed, the Democratic letter was released on May 6.</p>

	<p>WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE THEY SITTING ON THEIR HANDS FOR? The corporate conservative media is at it again.</p>

	<p>What amazes me was that not only did the memo nail the fixing of intelligence, but the fact we were telling the British war was inevitable before Bush told the American people that it wasn&#8217;t.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s not enough to impeach Bush, but it certainly is enough for me to lay the blood of tens of thousands at his feet. I&#8217;m sick of the lies and I&#8217;m sick of a media that won&#8217;t ask questions.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1217.html" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
