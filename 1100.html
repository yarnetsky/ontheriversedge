<div class="post">

<div class="entrytext">

	<p>The July/August issue of Utne magazine features an article by &#8220;street librarian&#8221; Chris Dodge entitled &#8220;Knowledge for sale: Why American libraries are in trouble.&#8221;</p>

	<p>If you want to know what the left thinks about libraries, I consider this a must read article. <a href="http://www.utne.com/magazine/newsstand/utne130_knowledge-for-sale.pdf">Knowledge for Sale</a> (also <a href="http://www.utne.com/magazine/newsstand/utne130_monastic-librarians.pdf">Monastic Librarians</a>). From an academic standpoint, there&#8217;s not a ton of depth, but it&#8217;s very interesting nonetheless.</p>

	<p>He hit on some interesting issues, some of which I struggle with myself at my library&#8212;specifically issues on purchasing and cataloging. I agree with him on both issues. Here are his thoughts and my thoughts&#8230;</p>

	<p><strong>On purchasing&#8230;</strong></p>

	<p>If we continue to move toward the demand-model of material selection and/or outsourse the selection process, Dodge argues the collections will become skewed to the popular and mass appeal. As a result, we ignore the minority communities or minority interests. I wholeheartedly agree, though I think people have come to expect the demand model from libraries.</p>

	<p>At our library I do some AV purchasing and subscribed to the Film Movement series from Recorded Books. I like it because we now have same access to award-winning films in little ol&#8217; Madison as the hot shots in New York and LA. It&#8217;s a total of 12 DVDs a year, not a large number considering I order at least 180 DVDs a year.</p>

	<p>While a number of people have told me they liked the series, one person wrote in our annual survey (paraphased) &#8220;stop buying all that foreign junk.&#8221;  After some thought I concluded the problem wasn&#8217;t one of an an imbalanced collection, but rather all the popular titles I&#8217;ve purchased are constantly in circulation so you have to show up at exactly the right time (or put them on hold) to snag them. As a result, the collection certainly looks skewed to the obtuse. I think I&#8217;ll create a paper catalog of DVD titles as people rarely bother to search the catalog to see if we have a title.</p>

	<p><strong>On Cataloging&#8230;</strong></p>

	<p>Dodge also wrote how our standardized catalog systems are unintuitive, severely hampering access to materials.</p>

	<p>Having taken &#8220;bibliographic access and control&#8221; I certainly understand the need for standardization. Obviously, a catalog without controlled vocabulary and name/subject authority is obviously chaos.</p>

	<p>However, I&#8217;d definitely consider myself a Sandynista. Dodge wrote about the work of Hennepin County (minn.) cataloger Sandy Berman who, through extensive bibliographic record notes and alternative titles and subjects, created a catalog that was very user friendly. Unfortunately, in the name of standardization, the library system reversed his work after he retired. I think that&#8217;s a sickening shame.</p>

	<p>We have a generally easy to use online catalog (Sirsi iBistro), but it is severely lacking in that is has no capabilities to share sees/see alsos. Thus the only way to get around this is to do a Berman-style bibliographic record. (although it&#8217;d obviously be better for Sirsi and other search engines to get their act together).</p>

	<p>Similarly, authors have to be types in &#8220;last name, first name&#8221; yet there are no obvious &#8220;tips&#8221; on the page to tell anyone that.  A person can go away thinking we have absolutely no books on a topic of interest.</p>

	<p>Similarly, our library is now in the process of starting a second digital library. On the first I argued we needed alternative catagories as noone will type in dwellings when they are searching for photos of &#8220;Madison homes.&#8221; I was overruled by a very experienced and very wise cataloger who stressed we needed to stick with standards. I am grateful to her as starting off on the right foot and doing the project &#8220;right&#8221; has helped us get a federal grant to do a second digital library.</p>

	<p>This new project is one of the first in the Indiana Digital Library project that aims to create digital projects that can be shared so they can be &#8220;harvested&#8221; by search engines. Standardization is a must for this to work, yet the problem of &#8220;will a person search using LC subject terms?&#8221; still exists.</p>

	<p>A number of us agreed at a workshop sponsored by the Indiana State Library that we needed to include alternative subjects in addition to official &#8220;LC&#8221; subject terms.</p>

	<p>This whole debate obviously opens a whole can of worms, but I think it&#8217;s one that needs to be opened. Fried worms anyone?</p>

	<p><strong>Here are two links&#8230;</strong></p>

	<p><a href="http://madison-jeffco.cdm.oclc.org">The Lemen Collection</a></p>

	<p>This is the first digital library the Madison-Jefferson County Public Library did. I was in charge of the tech side of the project, scanning and customizing the web templates to fit our desires.</p>

	<p><a href="http://openstacks.net/os/archives/000732.html#000732">Open Stacks #1</a></p>

	<p>This is the first podcast of Open Stacks by my friend Greg Schwartz. His premiere episode delves deeply into Adam Mathes&#8217; paper on folksonomies. If you&#8217;re interested in cataloging I think you&#8217;d find the podcast (an mp3 audio file) to be fascinating.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1217.html" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
