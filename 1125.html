	<p>One of these days I&#8217;ll recover from having all our nieces and nephews stay here. It was a lot of fun and I didn&#8217;t think about work, school, politics or the historic board for three whole days&#8212;a wonderful combination.</p>

<strong>One more tale</strong>. At the last minute Saturday night we decided to take the kids camping up at Clifty Falls State Park. It was a planned event, but there was a lot of hemming and hawing from all of us that resulted in a late start (in part as we were all tired from a day of swimming). Because of the late start, I put on my general&#8217;s hat and ordered them around (you find me some kindling for our fire, you help your mom with the tents, you find me newspaper). I suspect the kids took a temporary, but definite dislike for me. Mind you, I figured if I didn&#8217;t keep them mushing it&#8217;d get dark and we wouldn&#8217;t have a camp. I&#8217;m glad I did (even if they still don&#8217;t like me) because just as we got it set up, we saw lighting in the distance. I hoped it would pass us by as had about every storm this summer, but it was not to be.

	<p>Meanwhile, the youngest niece of the group, Shannon, decided she wanted to sleep in her own tent. We knew by now it was going to rain so we put her tent smack dab in front of ours so she could scurry into ours if desired.</p>

	<p>Well, the rain started and Darlene, being the true aunt she is, called out &#8220;you doing okay over there?&#8221; A definite &#8220;yes&#8221; came back along with singing of &#8220;rain, rain, go away.&#8221; The thunder got louder and louder and Shannon kept saying she was fine, indeed, it sounded like she was having fun. Yet, it was the loudest storm I&#8217;d been out in in years&#8230;and she was having fun?</p>

	<p>Suddenly the wind buffeted our tent significantly and that&#8217;s when she lost it. As the wind rattled everything, Darlene quickly went over and grabbed up her stuff and she crawled into our tent. About a minute later we looked out into the storm and her tent was gone&#8212;it literally blew away. Even though some of the gang stayed up into the wee hours of the morning wandering around, noone found the tent until the next morning nestled in the woods several camp sites away.</p>

	<p>The guys, meanwhile, were drown out of their tent (rain came in through the zippers&#8212;it was an old tent).  We found them asleep in our van. They slept only four hours. I think I got six.</p>

	<p>After breakfast I dragged them (not really they readily came) on a two hour hike down into a gorge and back up again. Then we went boating on the Ohio River and swimming again later that day.</p>

	<p>Now you get the idea why I&#8217;m tired.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1217.html" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
