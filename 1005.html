	<p>We got back from vacation late on Saturday night. Boy it went too quick. We had a lot of fun though. Now we&#8217;re busting our butts getting ready for Darlene&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mudcatpottery.com">holiday open house</a>.</p>

	<p><b>Niagara Falls</b></p>

	<p>While we spent most of the week with my mom, we visited Niagara Falls for an evening and a morning.</p>

	<p>Our first stop was on Goat Island, the island that is between the American and Horseshoe Falls (sometimes called the &#8220;Canadian Falls&#8221; even though half of it is in the United States).</p>

	<p>We saw these weird white boxes everywhere and had to ask a ranger. They cover the stalks of lamp posts to protect them during the winter. Why? Well, the ranger said ice from the mist builds up all winter to a height of two dozen feet. &#8220;See those snow fenses? Those will soon be covered in ice and we&#8217;ll put two more layers on top of that before the winter is done.&#8221; No wonder the trees on the edge of the island are knarly.</p>

	<p>The ranger told us he was amazed at how people left their common sense at home when they visited. People regularly climb safety fenses for a better view or wade into the rapids. The rapids don&#8217;t look bad in places, but one slip and you are over the falls in 20 seconds. He even stopped a mom who was wading with her baby in the water off the Three Sister Islands. It&#8217;s even worse when he has to communicate danger to someone who doesn&#8217;t understand English.</p>

	<p>We stayed at a hotel near the international bridge. We got a good deal on a room complete with a jacuzzi, a king bed, a fake fireplace, odd wallpaper and way too many mirrors for our tastes. But hey it was fun.</p>

	<p>We walked all over the place that night. The falls are illuminated at night with huge colored beams from the Canadian side. The light show was nice, but watching mist from the Horseshoe Falls swirl and dance reflecting the colored lights was downright cool.</p>

	<p>Literally and figuratively. If you&#8217;ve never been to the falls, there is a zone where it rains 24-7. In the summer it&#8217;s blessedly cool, but in the fall and winter it is downright freezing. Thus we truly enjoyed the jacuzzi when we walked back to the hotel.</p>

	<p><b>Buffalo-Erie County Public Library</b></p>

	<p>We visited the Buffalo-Erie County Public Library and I had a rather interesting experience.</p>

	<p>First strike. I walked into the downtown branch and saw a kiosk design I liked so I went to take a picture to share the idea with my director. Instantly the security guards pounced and ordered me not to take the photo. When I explained why I wanted the photo and asked why I couldn&#8217;t take it, they escorted me clear across the library to the administrative offices. Apparently they had a slew of places they didn&#8217;t want photos taken so they just made a blanket &#8220;no photos without permission&#8221; policy. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not posted anywhere and having a security guard sic you isn&#8217;t the best way of implementing the policy. Whatever.</p>

	<p>Second strike. I had to email an ad to our local paper. I called ahead to see if the library had CD drives so I wouldn&#8217;t have to drag my laptop to a downtown wi-fi hotspot. The person on the phone said sure, no problem. I get down there with CD in hand and they did not have CD drives. Bad information. grrrrrrrrrrrr. Maybe the good Lord was trying to give me one of those &#8220;this is why you need to double-check your information before telling patrons&#8221; kind of lessons.</p>

	<p>Third strike. Mark Twain lived in Buffalo for about 18 months. He was part owner of a daily paper there and had just married. They left after tragedy struck her family and moved to Elmira, NY. Either way, Buffalo is proud of its Twain year and the library was given the ORIGINAL manuscript of Huck Finn. I saw several pages of the manuscript. It&#8217;s wonderful to see the effort of handwriting. As a result, the library gift shop has a lot of Twain memorabilia. Unfortunately, because I got dragged to the admin offices and talked with the tech guy to see if he could help me (he couldn&#8217;t) I missed seeing the gift shop. It closed three minutes before we got there.</p>

	<p>The central branch is undergoing a major renovation and I look forward to seeing the results. Unfortunately, the libraries are in danger of closing as Medicaid is eating the county&#8217;s budget alive. The county executive has threatened to close everything (libraries, zoo, etc.) if he doesn&#8217;t get a hike in sales tax to 9.25%. We&#8217;ll see what happens over the next two weeks.</p>

	<p><b>Frank Lloyd Wright</b></p>

	<p>Another favorite stop was touring the &#8220;opus&#8221; of Frank Lloyd Wright&#8217;s Prarie-style homes&#8212;the <a href="http://www.darwinmartinhouse.org/">Darwin Martin House</a>.</p>

	<p>It was built in 1903-1905 for Martin who was a top executive with the huge Larkin Soap Company. Unfortunately, during the depression he lost a boat load of money (like everyone else) and died deeply in debt. As a result his wife had to abandon the property. It was then vacant for nearly 15 years when a local architect bought it and saved it from destruction. Now, umpteen years later, they are working on giving it a proper restoration.</p>

	<p>Wright&#8217;s attention to detail was astounding, he literally designed to control the house&#8217;s occupants. Through the design, he controlled where you walked, where you stopped, where you looked and, because he even designed almost all the furniture, how you lived. Amazing.</p>

	<p>The 90-minute tour was well worth the $10 ticket. I&#8217;ll visit it again in a couple years to see the progress.</p>

	<p>Wright did a lot of work in Buffalo, in large part due to Darwin Martin. Wright did a crack job for Martin because he knew his company was wanting a new corporate headquarters. He indeed got the contract and the resulting <a href="http://www.pbs.org/flw/buildings/larkin/larkin.html">Larkin Building</a> was not only his first major project, but also rather innovative. Unfortunately, when Larkin closed they could not come up with another use for the structure and it was demolished in 1950.</p>

	<p>Other structures were planned, but not built. The city is now working on completing several of his unfinished projects. One of them just finished is the &#8220;Blue Sky Mausoleum&#8221; which at first seems odd, but slowly strikes one as very peaceful. It grows on you. Here&#8217;s an <a href="http://archrecord.construction.com/news/daily/archives/041122wright.asp">article</a> on the project from Architectural Record.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1217.html" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
