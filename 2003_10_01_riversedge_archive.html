<h6>{Read}</h6>		

<ul>
<li><b>Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators</b>: When I was a kid, this was my favorite series of mysteries. I found one at a bookstore once and have been collecting them since. They're a lot of fun, good solid fluff reading now, but definitely a good read for 3-5 graders it features three California boys who together formed an investigation agency that tackles the craziest mysteries featuring things from singing serpents and crooked cats to screaming clocks and dancing devils. The mysteries are puzzles, but fair-- a sharp kid can solve them along with first investigator Jupiter Jones. I love their business card. It features three question marks ??? �The question mark is the universal symbol of something unknown. We are prepared to solve any puzzle, riddle, mystery, enigma, or conundrum which may be brought to us,� Jupiter Jones explains in the first book. As a reference assistant and someone who loves to encourage kids to read, these guys are my heroes.</li>
</ul>


<h6>{Listen}</h6>	

<ul>
<li><b>Jimmy Buffett</b> "Meet Me in Margaritaville." This is Buffett's latest greatest hits package. There are a few good tunes I had not heard and a few mildly disappointing live versions of favorites. I liked "Feeding Frenzy" better. B-</li>
<li><b>The Mighty Lemon Drops</b> "World Without End" A late 80s British band. The first half is pretty good punk pop. The second half is a bit slow. The tune "Inside Out" is great. B-</li>
<li><b>Dave Bruback Quartet</b> "Time Out" an oldie but goodie jazz album I listened to as a kid and have rediscovered. The album's lead piece "Blue Rondo A La Turk" is even better than "Take Five" which became a hit. Grade A-</li>
</ul>


<h6>{Watch}</h6>	

<ul>
<li>"<b>The Love Bug</b>" Darlene and I have recently watched several classic Disney flicks including "The Absent Minded Professor" and "The Shaggy Dog". Good stuff actually. The Love Bug mixed a good dose of automotive philosphy with 60s humor yet it never seemed forced. Buddy Hackett was great and Dean Jones was perfect as a person who was "half a man" if he wasn't racing cars.</li>
<li>"<b>Charade</b>": Cary Grant and Audry Hepburn star in this thriller where you are not quite sure if Grant is a good guy or murderer, yet the two get along famously. Lots of romantic wit and suspense. Great date movie. Grade A- as Hepburn's a bit too sappy at times.</li>
<li>Two movies that just came out in video/DVD that are really good. "<a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0266543/"><b>Finding Nemo</b></a>" and "<a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0286499/"><b>Bend It Like Beckham</b></a>."

          <b>Site news</b>: I just found a cool php script that allows me to rotate the photos on my home page everytime the page loads. I'll have to upload more photos/photo art just to see it in practice. As Darlene says, I'm having way too much fun.<br />

          <b>Just a couple of days of busy stuff</b><br /><br />It's been a couple of busy days around here.<br /><br />Yesterday, I attended a pretty decent library conference on marketing reference services (or the reference "experience" as one library director calls it.) <br /><br />There were a number of good suggestions on how to market reference (along with simply getting people to come in the door.) Other speakers had comments that had me wondering what their point was and why they felt their comments had any applicability to the subject at hand. I guess that's just par for the course.<br /><br />I've definitely concluded that I need to be more outgoing on the reference desk (if you can imagine that). People just are not seeing us and we need to change that.<br /><br />Today, I'm trying to fix damage I cause to a website. It amazes me how a website can look great in one browser and break into pieces in another browser. Fortunately, I've finally figured out why it was broken and I think I have the problems solved.<br /><br />I need to stop in at another client's workplace to see if they have some of the materials I need to finish their project. Then it's a drive to the hilltop to get new license plates and pay van insurance.<br /><br />Then maybe I'll have time to stop and think about life, the universe and everything.<br />

          <b>All's Fair in Love and Euchre</b><br /><br />Note: If you don't understand euchre, don't even bother :)<br /><br />Every few weeks we play cards with our friends who own the local movie theatre. The Ratcliff's have two kids with a third on the way. Thus, when they can manage to get a babysitter, it's party night.<br /><br />Six-handed Euchre is the game of choice or Uno if we can't get six to play. We keep intending to invite others, but never get around to it.<br /><br />It was an even split on the night, Laura Ratcliff, Josiah and I won the first round. Tony Ratcliff, our friend Caryl and Darlene won the second round on a misdeal. <br /><br />We were both in the barn and I was halfway through the winning hand when we realized Darlene dealt me an extra card -- it was a sticky deck. A misdeal was called and Josiah dealt Darlene the winning hand and we lost 10-9.<br /><br />If that was how the whole night went, I'd been pretty growly. However, it really made us even. <br /><br />In the first game, it was my deal and I lucked out. I got four hearts in my hand with a low heart turned up. I was planning to pick it up, but Darlene called hearts first. How I managed I don't know, but I kept a straight face the whole time and ruined her hand. She thought she won the last card and I slowly tossed down the last heart a second after they started celebrating.<br /><br />"Five hearts?! Five hearts!? How could I have known you had five hearts?!" Hearing Darlene say that alone was worth a million.<br />

          <a href="http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/authors/wiesner/home.html">David Wiesner - The Art of Visual Storytelling.</a><br /><br />With my sister-in-law Janie visiting, the topic turns to children's books. She's worked libraries and enjoys a good kids book. When she visited the library her first stop was the childrens' room where she grabbed a book for Darlene to read.<br /><br />When I work down there one night a week I try to sneak a read of a picture book or two. My favorites are without a doubt by David Wiesner (whom I know is also a favorite of a few of my friends). <br /><br />"Tuesday" is wonderful and well deserved its Caldecot Award. However, ranking right up there is his 1999 "Sector 7" which snagged a Caldecot Honor that year.<br /><br />Inspired, I searched the web and was psyched to find his book publisher has posted a very nice website.  They include enlargements of several of his drawings and an excellent article about the "creative process" behind "Tuesday" from the rough concepts and storyboards to his research and final paintings.<br /><br />Definitely worth a visit.<br />

          <strong>Boy, do I have a headache</strong><br /><br />The library is getting into the Halloween spirit-- everyone is wearing deely-boppers which are <a href="http://justdolphins.safeshopper.com/107/1037.htm?529">something to this effect</a> if you have never seen a pair before.<br /><br />I was a good sport and wore a pair as well. Mine had spiders on them while most everyone else had bats (which were cuter--though that may have been worse news for me). I received plenty of smiles to say the least including one woman who came in and said grimaced. "I won't look, I promise" smiled and of course looked and then covered her eyes. Yes, I looked darned silly.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the things have tines to stick in your hair and I simply don't have enough of that. Thus it stuck in my head. So I put tape on them and that helped a bit, but still after wearing the silly things for a while I ended up with a awful headache.<br /><br />Then again, tonight's meeting of the Madison Historic District Board of Review may also induce a headache. <br />

          <strong>Another Sunday</strong><br /><br />Another workweek has started all too quick. At least today we actually have our catalog working. I'll take blessings where I can get them.<br /><br />Expanded the selection of comics on the comics page, though I can't guarentee their quality or taste at this point. All I know is the titles sounded interesting. They are being "beamed" in from another website by javascript or *tooncasting* as it's called.<br /><br />Bloop.tv is pretty cool. Very nice animation.<br />

          <strong>Company came</strong><br /><br />Darlene's sister came to town this weekend for the first time in a year.  <br /><br />We had a fun day of hiking, sampling soups at a new festival in town "Soup, Stew, Chili and Brew" and then had a dinner of a super premium ice creme with a dessert of wonton soup and egg roles. Today we walked along the river and played euchre.<br /><br />When Janie visits everyone in town automatically knows that's Darlene's sister. They look alike in the face and hair, though Janie is a head taller (the only girl of four in the family with any height).<br /><br />When I'm wrapped in the finer things of being part of a big family, life feels rich.<br />

          <b>Morning has broken</b><br /><br />After several late hours of preparing for a visit by Darlene's sister, we finally crashed and a woke up feeling as broken as morning.<br /><br />The morning sun comes in our east facing windows first thing so, because of Darlene's light sensitive eyes, we added a second curtain.<br /><br />We really don't have a good way of hanging these second curtains so I bought ones with loops and hung a loop on either side of the existing curtain that in turn is on a spring-loaded curtain rod.<br /><br />As a result, if you can visualize this, the center of the second curtain is hanging loose.<br /><br />Back to the morning sun. It hits us directly and shines through the area where the second curtain is sagging. On the far wall a "grin" suddenly appears like a Cheshire cat. The crinkled first curtain creating the illusion of teeth on the grin.<br /><br />After noticing this, we've been able to track the time within a few minutes and the season as it has slowly moved right along the west wall.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the grin is coming later and later. I'm going to hate waking up at 6:30 pretty darn soon.<br /><br />We're having a "Soup, Stew, Chilli and Brew" festival on Main Street today. We hope to do our sampling before it starts raining this afternoon. Better yet, her sister and her family will let us take them on a hike this morning to get our hunger up for soup, stew, chili and brew.<br /> <br /><b>Unusual link of the day</b> (courtesy of LISnews.com):<br />Latin Place Names file from the Association of College and Research Libraries / Rare Books and Manuscripts Section/ Bibliographic Standards Committee<br /><br />As found in the imprints of books printed before 1801 and their vernacular equivalents in AACR2  (Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules) form. <a href="http://www.lib.byu.edu/~catalog/people/rlm/latin/names.htm">Only in Americae!</a><br />

          <strong>Made the mistake of opening the mail</strong><br /><br />Our budget is shot for a while. We just received our property and business tax bills and they came in about twice what we expected. <br /><br />Indiana restructured its property assessment methods from an archaic "replacement value" system to a modern "market value" system. The change is hitting the historic district hard because old structures used to be valued low due to depreciation. Under the market system, there's higher demand thus a higher value on the property.<br /><br />We're lucky actually, I believe we were underassessed. Our assessed value climbed only 30 percent. Many properties downtown doubled if not tripled in value. In turn, our taxes climbed from about $930/year to $1250/year. Obviously, that's not bad compared to what some of our friends are facing. <br /><br />In the process, our tax bills were delayed. In a normal year we'd be able to split this amount in half payable in May and November. Because of the reassessment, the Spring bills never came so now we have to cough up the whole amount in about 30 days.<br /><br />It's not bad really, it's just that for some stupid reason we were expecting our homestead and mortgage deductions to kick in this year. They don't kick in until *next* year-- thus we owe a *lot* more than we expected.<br /><br />Now watch a few of my friends write me back asking why I'm complaining about a $1,250 bill when theirs are a lot higher. Hey, what can I say... we were spoiled.<br />

          <b>River Bottom Reading</b><br /><br />I hosted a prose and poetry reading at the library last night. It was a quiet affair where people simply came up to the microphone and read their work for a few minutes. We had a better turnout than I expected so it made for a nice evening. There are some good writers here.<br /><br />I read a story I've been trying to write for about a dozen years. I wrote it and have been rewriting it ever since. It still isn't what I hoped it could be, but hearing myself read it aloud helped me identify where some of the holes are. Unfortunately, they range in the dozens.<br /><br />I believe I was a decent journalistic writer, but being a fiction writer is another ball of wax. You need to be able to hear the voices of the characters and you have to create a story and twists someone will spend their time reading. I was lucky. I had to dig for my information, but everyone else gave me the stories and twists. Counting on my own mind to invent the stuff seems impossible in contrast.<br /><br />

          <strong>Laundry Night</strong><br /><br />Last night was laundry night. As much of a pain as it may be to leave the house and go to a laundrymat, it's kind of fun too.<br /><br />It's a ritual. We quickly load everything into the triple-loaders and go a couple of doors down to the look in the window of the downtown pet store.<br /><br />There is always a cage of cute kittens. Sometimes they're climbing over each other and pawing at the windows. Last night they were sleeping. Their four sets of eyes were four sets of lines above their pink noses. Two butterscotch tabbies and two calico tabbies.<br /><br />In the next window were a dozen mice running all over and under each other. Watching four mice on a wheel is a hoot. They're all trying to go in opposite directions and if one stops running they end up doing a couple loops. Then there were the guinea pigs (no thanks, they make me very sick). <br /><br /><strong>What I'm listening to</strong>: New Music Tuesday on <a href="http://www.woxy.com/">WOXY</a> from my old college town. Excellent modern rock. It reminds me of the good stuff from the 80s, but with more edge. Their stream is live on the Internet. I downloaded iTunes for Windows the other day (as earlier noted). I don't have any music on my computer to listen to, but the program does have a list of a few dozen radio stations to listen to.<br /><br /><br />

          <strong>Sundays</strong><br /><br />Sundays at the library can be unpredictable. Sometimes our online catalog works. Sometimes it doesn't. Today it isn't. Once a week they rebuild the database and as a result, it is not showing us any items after 1995.<br /><br />So far, however, no one has asked us where a book is located. To make life a little easier I have a simple <a href="http://www.tnrdlib.bc.ca/dewey.html">Dewey Decimal Classification</a> chart pulled up. Unfortunately, it doesn't go into a lot of detail. If someone asks about the disease of the week, it doesn't give you much help. Saying "go look in 614 just doesn't cut it."<br />

          <b>Tall Stacks</b><br /><br />Boy is it a beautiful day. The sky is crispy blue and the sun is as warm as a fresh Crispy Creme. <br /><br />Up in Cincinnati is the <a href="http://www.tallstacks.org">Tall Stacks Festival</a>. More than a dozen riverboats from across the country are there.<br /><br />Several of the boats putted past en route. The Delta and Mississippi Queens stopped here for several hours on Thursday. Darlene took the photo on top of the page and I had fun with it turning it into a pastel drawing using Photoshop.<br /><br />The Delta Queen returned today and I helped take a group of two dozen people from the riverboat on a tour of downtown today. It was part of my training to become a walking tour guide next year. They were taking a two day trip from Cincinnati to Madison and back. I didn't get a chance to go on the boat, maybe in future trips. But I did get some nice photos. As I type, the coliape just started playing and the boat paddled past. It's great to see the river from our front door. <br /><br />There's also a nice crowd of leafers in town and several of them stopped by and bought mugs and tiles. It kept Darlene busy most of the afternoon. Right now we're waiting for the kiln to cool so we can take a load up to the gallery in Columbus, Indiana. That's life on the river's edge.<br />

          <strong>No joy in Mudville</strong><br /><br />It brought the joy of baseball back in my heart. The possibilities were great. The luvable Cubbies versus the Red Sox of my dad's hometown in the World Series. Neither had won in so long, it would have been the best series in history.<br /><br />But, no the Cubs had to blow three games straight and the Red Sox couldn't hold a 5-2 lead past the eighth inning. So now I get to choose between a team I have always hated or a team I have never cared for. I'm not even going to bother.<br /><br />So I guess it's on to football. Now if the Buffalo Bills would just win again. They're like my Kansas City Royals, the season started out with such promise before sliding into mediocrity.<br /><br /><br />

          <strong>Riverboats in town</strong><br /><br />It's fun when we have a riverboat in town. Today we had two--the Delta Queen and the Mississippi Queen. The Mississippi Queen docked with her platform on our city's boat ramp and the Delta placed her ramp on the Mississippi. Darlene went down and snapped some photos and I hope to post one this weekend.<br /><br />Things happen when the boats come. You can't buy a newspaper anywhere because the "boat people" snag them all. They come to the library to check their email. A number of them also stopped by the studio to watch Darlene throw pots. She said we had guests from Utah, Nevada and California.<br /><br />I'm trying to put the finishing touches on promo material for our historical photo collection.<br /><br />This is the first post to the new website.

          <strong>What can I say, it's a Wednesday (I'd rather have a Monday.)</strong><br /><br />It's a beautiful day and I'm preparing to look at computer screens for the next couple hours. <br /><br />Nor am I looking forward to tonight. There are a ton of kids books to shelve. I think the fact you can't just shelve a kid's book is what makes it hard- with the easy readers you have to look at five books before you can shelve the one because the ID tags are not on the spine, but on the front of the book.<br /><br />Maybe I can bribe Darlene to spending an hour or two of her time tonight and at least keeping me company while I'm shelving.<br /><br />Tonight we'll be showing "North By Northwest" as our free movie. I wish I could skip shelving and watch that instead. Tomorrow we're holding an open house here at the library to premier our long-range plan and also our new online photo collection. That should be fun (if not fun at least there will be good, catered munchies).<br /><br />We finally decided on a place to put our pots here in Madison. We'll have an open house one or two afternoons a week, but we needed a reliable place to put the pots for the majority of the sales. I think <a href="http://www.shopwhimsy.com/">Whimsy</a> will do a good job with them. We'll probably take them some pots this weekend. <br /><br />Saturday morning I'm going to learn how to give historic walking tours downtown. Historic Madison, Inc. is going to put me in their stable of tour guides for next year. I'll get paid about $25 for two hours work and get to go on the <a href="http://www.deltaqueen.com/">big riverboats</a> to meet the passengers for the tours. That should be fun.<br /><br />I'm off to apply "NT Profile Locking Tool" and "Secure NT Registry" to a few of our public computers. I hope it works. They've been getting infected with spyware that highjacks the web browser and sends it off to site that plaster the screen with pop-up ads. Yuch, what a pain.<br />

          <strong>Fall is here</strong><br />It is really turning beautiful in this rivertown. The leaves are losing their green, albeit reluctantly. The colors are not brilliant, dull golds and browns. Some red and orange to spice things up. Mind you, I don't think we'l be at peak for another week give or take.<br /><br />Darlene and I took a nice hike at the Clifty Canyon Nature Preserve, a park of the state park here in town. We have a favorite trail because it goes through mini-canyons and past waterfalls. We usually go the same direction every time, but decided to be contrary and go the opposite way. <br /><br />It is truly amazing how different the same area looks when you go uphill instead of downhill. There is one stretch of the trail that is literally on the cusp of a 20-foot cliff. We had become used to it and stopped thinking about it. Going the other way it suddenly looked ominous. Just awesome.<br /><br />Biking to work is great, my wheels crunching in a hum across all the fallen leaves. Our parking lot is just covered, rice crispies from one end to the other.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the beautiful weather won't last. Tomorrow it'll rain and the cool temperatures will return later this week. I think I'll drag Darlene on a walk tonight (not that it will be an effort-she'll probably drag me first).<br /><br />

In my mail box today was a copy of the article. Ouch.

Then in turn I can't get back to sleep that night because I slept too long in the afternoon. grrr. <br /><br />This weekend I popped six web logs together so two of my clients can update their own webpages without worrying about whether I'm too busy to get the job done. Now I just have to get them trained. Can old dogs learn new tricks? I think this will be easier than trying to teach them how to design websites from scratch which they both originally wanted to do.<br /><br />Maybe now that they're mostly done I can reduce the stress a little. Of course, they'll need some other kind of updates to keep me busy. I just wish they weren't barter jobs. Mind you I did have some very fresh bagels and cinnamon rolls for breakfast this morning.<br /><br />I need to start saying no and stop taking on projects. Before I got the library job I wanted to get the projects so bad in order to pay the bills. Now I'm doing them to get cash for my computer junk and to show everyone they should have hired me earlier. Moonlighting to buy goodies is one thing, but I know the later reason has little reason to it. Mind you, when I said yes, I wasn't planning on taking the stupid GRE.<br /><br />I think it's time to quit for the night and veg to the tune of a MASH episode or two.<br />

          <b>Ah the weekend.</b><br /><br />OK, I survived my Thursday. Got a decent night's sleep and took another nap this afternoon. Darlene is a siren of the afternoon nap...<br /><br />Now I'm trying to get a website redesigned so the baker can update her weekly specials on her own. I'm hoping designing a set of blogs will do the trick.<br /><br /><b>What I'm reading</b>: "The Sands of Time" by Michael Hoeye. "A Hermux Tantamoq Adventure (TM)." <br /><br />This is a great children's mystery-adventure series set in a mythical world of mice. Very English and literate for a kids book. <br /><br />Hermux is a gentle, but brave "everymouse" and watchmaker. His old friend was blind for three year and her sight was saved by Hermux in the previous book (though I don't remember how). She is an artist and her first exhibit having sight restored is of visions she had when she was blind. But HORRORS- the paintings are of... gasp... CATS!!! Nude ones at that. In the mouse world cats were aweful mythical beasts that are *never* spoken of in public. However, Hermux ends up in an adventure that aims to prove them all wrong.<br /><br />Read the first book "Time Stops for No Mouse" first. These are a great workday reads as the chapters are each only 2-3 pages long. As I get a task done, I've been allowing myself to read a chapter. I couldn't get away with that at work, but hey when I moonlight I do it right.<br />

          <strong>zzzzzz</strong><br /><br />I'm doing everything I can to avoid falling asleep at the reference desk this afternoon. Just didn't sleep well at all last night. <br /><br />Part of the problem is Darlene and I fell into a bad habit of eating in bed. Last winter was cold and the covers kept us warm. Now it is indeed a habit and the crumbs end up everywhere. We'll brush off the sheets, but you can guarentee there will be crumbs in the covers. Thus, whenever we flip, more crumbs end up in the bed.<br /><br />Also the bed is seeing the end of its usefulness. Since the Madison Chautauqua was good to us, we have money. We decided to work on plumbing instead of buying a new mattress set.  However, after a night of flipping like pancakes, we're questioning our decision.<br /><br />Of course, once I woke up my mind (partially delirious having not eaten for 8 hours) wouldn't shut down. My mind kept trying figure a way to balance my moonlighting with prepping for the GRE. I need to relearn a bunch of math, but I also need to get some website coding done. There just isn't time for both. Meanwhile, the back half of my mind was praying for an old friend who yesterday bid farewell.<br /><br />There's hardly anyone in the library this afternoon (where are they?) so I've already gotten a lot of work done. I just wish someone would ask me a reference question so I can stay awake.<br />

Part of me is tempted to put it off a semester to give me more time, but then I don't know if the scholarships would be as available as they are in the fall.<br /><br />Even if I don't do the site, the director welcomed my input on the decision process and that is good because their <a href="http://www.visitmadison.org/">website</a> needs a big improvement.

Mind you the ones I hit were pretty good pitches. <br /><br />I was able to find the monthly average price for chicken over the past three years. According to the patron neither her professor nor the ref folks at the Indiana University Southeast Library were able to find that one.<br /><br />The ones I missed were "I happened to see #### and can't find it again." They unfortunately didn't remember enough information for me to find it for them. *sigh*<br /><br />Meanwhile I'm trying to whip our historical photos website into shape and am only partially succeeding in that endeavor.<br /><a href="http://madison-jeffco.cdm.oclc.org">The Lemen Collection</a> is making its debut in two weeks and I have many tweaks to go.<br />

          <b>Oof, I need a bike ride</b><br />It's truly amazing how fast a body can fall apart. I have not gone on my daily bike ride since Friday and boy am I feeling it. Everything's gone stiff and sore. I need to get back to it tomorrow.<br /><br />This sudden chilly weather doesn't help either. At night we're huddled under a pile of blankets and don't want to get up in the morning. I think it's time to quit pretending this is a cabin and plug in our heater tonight.<br /><br />Darlene and I are also trying to figure out a way of getting each other out of our little worlds. I'm wrapped up at the library and she in her pots. We went swimming all the time during the summer and miss it terribly-it was our exercise, talking and socializing time and we haven't had that since mid-August. This vacation is starting to help, but we're trying to find a way of not having that "together time" end suddenly.<br /><br />I need to put the chicken on the grill. One of those cheap $13 George Foreman grills was the best buy we've made in a long time--meat tastes great out of that little thing.<br />

          <b>What I'm reading</b><br />Star Trek: New Frontier "Gods Above"<br />New Frontier is a great series that is independent from all the tv shows. Author Peter David has created a set of characters that are simply wonderful. Deep and very funny. Start with book one and work your way through.<br /><br /><b>Tech I'm playing with</b><br />I just got my wireless Internet up and running. No more hooking a phone cord into my laptop. I can now surf anywhere in our building. When I helped a local denist with his Macs he gave me the base station for free ($200 value-wow). Today I bought the card for the laptop. It works great.<br /><br />Also, I'm playing with an rss/xml news reader. interesting.<br /><br />Spent the day in Louisville shopping for clothes. I'm set for fall, Darlene's still looking for shirts. It was nice to get out of town.<br />
