	<p>To avoid nightmares&#8212;DON&#8217;T DRIVE IN THE FIRST SNOW OF THE SEASON!</p>

	<p>Darlene and I went to Columbus, Indiana, last night which is about an hour&#8217;s drive from here to drop off some pots at a gallery and to pickup the brochure I designed from the printers.</p>

	<p>It wasn&#8217;t too bad on the way up, people were driving slow, but that&#8217;s to be expected. On the way home, however, that one hour drive became a 2-1/2 hour drive.</p>

	<p>I knew the roads were starting to get a bit slick because you&#8217;d feel a little slipping on starting and stopping. I saw a salt truck behind me so I pulled off in order to drive on the salt. I turned off and started to turn around when sliiiide-bang. I kissed a cement retaining wall in front of a church. Fortunately I was only going 3-5mph. I bent the bumper, but I lucked out in that it didn&#8217;t puncture the tire (an inch away). I was able to pull the bumper out enough to keep going with no problems.</p>

	<p>For the next 90 minutes everyone was driving 15-20 mph on a state highway. People were spun out on the sides of the road. An instant later two cars ahead of me a guy going north spins out into our lane and ends up going south. I saw it and slowed down in time, but I&#8217;m amazed the guy in front of me didn&#8217;t get plastered.</p>

	<p>Once traffic let up, things were better and I was going a nice slow and consistant 35. The roads got a little better as we went south.</p>

	<p>Then I made the mistake of assuming the state highway garage had plowed one of our steep hills going into downtown Madison. It was SLICK. A woman had spun out big time, blocking the road and I was the first to come up behind her. She was screaming that she didn&#8217;t know how to get out of the slide area. Meanwhile, our van was slipping all over the place and I narrowly avoided slidding into another car next to me.</p>

	<p>We finally got down the hill in low gear and I thought we were home free when a guy came flying up the street making an opposite left at the same time I was. Out of the corner of my eye I saw him spin out and barely managed to move out of getting hit in the rear end.</p>

	<p>That would have been one thing, but then instead of letting me have my right-of-way, he peeled out going the same way I was and turned fast down the next block. As it was now midnight I wonder if he was drunk.</p>

	<p>Thus the nightmare and the lesson learned&#8230; don&#8217;t drive in the season&#8217;s first snow.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/index.html?id=1217" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
