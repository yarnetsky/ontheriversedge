	<p><strong>note</strong>: OK, I&#8217;m back. I&#8217;ve been moving from my summer schedule to my school year schedule (at work, school, etc.) and as a result haven&#8217;t had a day off for a couple weeks. But fear not, put on your reading glazes and have a glass of <a href="http://www.thomasfamilywinery.us">wine</a> (whine?)... it&#8217;s blogging time&#8230;</p>

	<p>There is no doubt that the gulf coast needs relief as whole communities have been flooded or wiped off the maps by the Hurricane Katrina. The urge is righteous, but the face is wrong.</p>

	<p>The face in question is Karl Rove. I find it interesting that George W. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/15/politics/15bush.html">just put his head political crony in charge of reconstruction</a>.<br />
How can Rove, the person charged with keeping our nation divided and floating political blame, understand how to rebuild New Orleans and the Gulf Coast? Then again, Bush <em>was</em> the person who put a diploma-mill horse attorney with no emergency managment experience in charge of the Federal Emergency Management Agency so I guess it makes sense.</p>

	<p>Yet, I also realize this is the administration that literally lost $8 billion (with a capital B) in Iraq with absolutely no clue as to where it went. I guess a tiger can&#8217;t change its stripes.</p>

	<p>Other signs of trouble:</p>

	<p>*The recent approved $50B+ relief bill eliminated a lot of the oversight on contracts and credit card charging. </p>
	<p>*The Republicans want a partisan commission to <del>look into</del> cover up the tragedy.</p>
	<p>*Bush announced they are planning to rebuild the gulf coast without so much as one bit of sacrifice in our budget. </p>

	<p>Hmmm&#8230; how can we pay for a war, huge tax cuts for Bush cronies, stupid budget priorities and the gulf rebuilding without a sacrifice somewhere in the system? This combination is going to kill our economy. </p>

	<p>Oddly, it&#8217;s kind of nice to see a few conservatives finally <br />
foam at the mouth. A couple of Republican senators and congressmen (ie Sen. Tom Coburn R-OK) want dollar for dollar budget cuts in exchange for rebuilding the gulf coast.</p>

	<p>The bottom line is that I smell the coming of the biggest fiscal fiasco/crisis/debacle/boondogle/ in our nation&#8217;s history. If we don&#8217;t have independent auditors on this puppy we&#8217;re going to lose our shirts.</p>

	<p>This is not a question of should we help. A few conservatives talk as if  we should not help rebuild the coast. We should&#8212;though with strict construction guidelines to avoid future loses. </p>

	<p>Rather, this is a question of how do we keep this administration honest when it is known they have no fiscal (or any other) accountability because we need to make sure this money helps rebuild communities&#8212;not illegally pad the profits of Halliburton and related corporate ilk.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/index.html?id=1217" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
