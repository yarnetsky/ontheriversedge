	<p>I&#8217;ve finally gotten enough ducks in a row for grad school&#8212;though a few are still quacking and straggling behind.</p>

	<p>Today I plunked down my $50 and submitted my application to the Indiana University School of Library and Information Science.</p>

	<p>I still need to send them one of my transcripts. I ordered them, but somehow I have a bill of $106 at Bowling Green State University. I haven&#8217;t the foggiest how it got there as I had transferred to Miami University with no problem. The only thing Darlene can think of is she got a parking ticket driving a car in my name. Thus, no transcript. Go figure.</p>

	<p>Also I need to get my recommendations in, or rather herd my recommendations in. So far only one of people who agreed to be references has turned in their work. Another promised to finish it this week. I haven&#8217;t talked to the third. It&#8217;s actually a bit of work. There&#8217;s about a dozen questions to answer and an essay to write (up to 5000 characters). While I joke about herding ducks, I really appreciate their willingness to do so.</p>

	<p>I talked to the one gentleman who wrote me a reference. He is a retired academic library director who serves on our board. He is amazingly happy that I decided to pursue the profession and promised to be on my back until I finished the masters. I&#8217;ll take the encouragement where I can get it.</p>

	<p>I had known him for several years as a reporter. But, not long after I started at the library, I unknowingly helped out his father with some reference questions. He later told me that his father came home that day and really complimented the service. Ever since then he&#8217;s asked me every six months or so if I was planning to pursue an MLS.</p>

	<p>I suspect it goes a little further than that. Like myself, he stumbled across librarianship from another profession and found he enjoyed it. There are still so few men in the profession (I think I read 21%) that when a new one joins in, the current men rejoice?</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1217.html" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
