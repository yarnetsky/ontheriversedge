	<p>Our library has been trying to get away from using our tech consultant as much this year, but it seems we&#8217;re instead using him more.</p>

	<p>Yesterday is a good example. We got sassed pretty bad by that Sasser.c worm. It started shutting down a couple of our computers on Saturday and Sunday and knocked out several more on Monday. I had updated many of our public access machines and OPACs with the latest patches after hearing of the lastest critical patch from Microsoft, but a few staff machines out of my domain had not been updated in a while and got hit.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, to &#8220;cure&#8221; the problem, the first thing was to insure the firewall was installed or installed properly. I know little about firewalls beyond how they work&#8230; so here comes the consultant again. Fortunately I was around when he came and I plumbed him for information&#8212;though I still don&#8217;t know about the mechanical firewall. He did suggest trying ZoneAlarm on our Windows2000 computers. I&#8217;m test driving it now.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, the computer we use for our pretty cool <a href="http://madison-jeffco.cdm.oclc.org">digitization project</a> has been on the fritz for weeks and, after several attempts, Gateway finally sent us the right parts. Apparently the panel that controls the hard drives went south.</p>

	<p>Finally, I need to send our wireless Internet project out for quotes as we want a pro to do the initial setup. We received a Library Services and Technology Act grant I wrote for the project and have just returned the paperwork to the state library.</p>

	<p>I sent my draft to the head of technology at the local college for a critique and I still haven&#8217;t heard back. I need to give him a call tomorrow. I&#8217;d hope to be started by now, but it&#8217;ll happen.</p>

	<p>Starting June 1, our building will be undergoing a massive building project to install and entirely new heating, air conditioning, ventilation system. Different parts of the building will be disrupted and the ability to move computers around at will would be nice to say the least.</p>

	<p>Dealing with technology is part of my job description, but after weeks like this I wonder if I should study computers as opposed to library science.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1217.html" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
