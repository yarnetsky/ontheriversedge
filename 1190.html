	<p>...Sometimes I wonder if <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/gallery/tv2/marvin.shtml">Marvin the Paranoid Android</a> had it right.</p>
	<p>This morning I had a dream I was on the phone arguing with the electric company over a $128,000 bill. &#8220;But I&#8217;m a librarian I only make xxx dollars a year!&#8221; (as if it would do any good explaining that.) They were charging me $60,000 because they were closing the Madison office of all things.</p>
	<p>I finally got mad (or madder rather) and hung up. I was panicking because I was running really late for work. I finally got to work and as I walked in my director said she needed to speak to me.</p>
	<p>At that moment the phone rang.  I woke up and realized I was indeed 30 minutes late for work as I had forgotten to turn on the alarm clock. I listened to the answering machine and it was a bill collector.</p>
	<p>I can understand dreaming about being late for work, but should I really be anticipating the call of a bill collector?</p>
	<p>That said, life has interceded and I admit I have not felt the urge to blog for the past few weeks. Basically, as Walt Crawford noted: <a href="http://cites.boisestate.edu/v5i13a.htm">Life Trumps Blogging</a></p>
	<p><strong>Life&#8230; not necessarily in this order&#8230;</strong></p>
	<p>1. My better half hasn&#8217;t been feeling well the last few months and we&#8217;re trying to figure out how to get her back to her usual self. She&#8217;s going on her fourth specialist so far with no diagnosis. It was a bill collector for the hospital that called this morning. They&#8217;re helping us try to figure out what we actually owe them as their billing system sucks.</p>
	<p>2. Life is hectic at the library and I&#8217;m trying to avoid the feeling of drowning because I took off time to be with Darlene (I&#8217;m slowly catching up again&#8230; I think).</p>
	<p>3. Classes started up again. I&#8217;m taking &#8220;Materials for children and young adults&#8221; and &#8220;Evaluation of Library Sources and Services.&#8221; Because of parts one and two (specifically part one), I&#8217;m not quite into the spirit of non-stop studying though the classes are interesting. Nonetheless, my 4.0 will most likely bite the dust this semester. I know that&#8217;s not really a bad thing as very, very, very few people ever care or check. Nonetheless, the concept is taking me a little bit of effort to accept.</p>
	<p>4. My mom got me <a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1164.html">this amazing book</a> for my birthday (39 on 2-10) and it is sitting there taunting me to read it, but I really do need to read more of my homework. I&#8217;ve read many books already for the kiddie lit class (really good stuff!)</p>
	<p>Something will get me writing again. I&#8217;m sure George Bush is plotting his next stupid human trick right now just to get me blogging. Then again, some days there is so much stupidity that I give up trying to keep up with it all.</p>
	<p>Until then&#8230; toodaloo caribou</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1217.html" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
