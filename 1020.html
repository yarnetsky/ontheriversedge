	<p>It&#8217;s beginning to look a lot like Christmas. A stack of gifts for family inside and a thickening bed of snow outside.</p>

	<p>Also, the Christmas shoppers finally decended on us last Saturday and that put us at ease. We sold enough pots to keep our bills up to date this winter. It&#8217;s rather odd to hope people will spend lots of money when we know its tough out there.  Nonetheless, this will probably be the first winter in our married lives that we can take out Chinese once a week and not feel guilty. Out of curiousity, Darlene talked with other merchants in downtown Madison and they&#8217;re having the same luck&#8212;it&#8217;s pretty slow this year.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, we are indeed getting our first &#8220;snow&#8221; of the winter. We had some flurries a week ago, but nothing stuck so it doesn&#8217;t count. Our latest forecast called for four inches today and three more tonight (at one point they called for 10 inches&#8212;darn).</p>

	<p>We&#8217;re driving north for a quick Christmas and Darlene&#8217;s family in the Lima, Ohio, area is expecting anything from 9 to 16 inches. Darlene&#8217;s sister (one of four) loves the snow, so Darlene emailed her &#8220;don&#8217;t get carried away&#8221; with prayers for white stuff so we can actually get into town. We have memories along those lines.</p>

	<p>Several years ago we traveled up to her parents for Christmas and our station wagon broke down on the highway. It was 2 a.m. and it was barely above 0 degrees. We lucked out royally as the only deputy on duty in the whole county happened upon us and we got rescued by her father.</p>

	<p>Well, this year it is again supposed to be frigid (in addition to the snow) so we did the unthinkable&#8230; we bought a cellphone. We were planning on getting one for my weekly commute to Indianapolis for grad school, but I wasn&#8217;t planning on buying the thing until next year (OK, two weeks from now).</p>

	<p>The experience was painful. I got a salesman at Radio Shack who was obviously trying to keep going as they had a long day. He kept saying things that weren&#8217;t true and added some pressure sales to boot. I hate that because it makes it hard to determine whether the person is telling you the &#8220;truth&#8221; in order to make good decisions or if he has bills to pay and is trying to pad his commission. In the end I ended up spending about $80 more than I thought as I bought a car charger and a warrenty.</p>

	<p>Part of the reason it was expensive is I decided to go with the &#8220;Pay As You Go&#8221; plan. If I don&#8217;t use it much I only have to pay $15/mo. to keep the phone number instead of $30-$50 a month under a contract.</p>

	<p><strong>Sigh</strong> Some things about 21st century technology I love, like my Powerbook and wireless Internet, but I&#8217;m just not sure about cell phones.</p>

	<p>So I could figure out how to use the damn thing, I took the phone with me to the grocery down the block and called Darlene. At least down here, the quality is a lot better than I expected. We&#8217;ve gotten cell calls that were really spotty and this one was crystal clear. After a few minutes I broke off the call to check out.</p>

	<p>A few minutes later Darlene called me. It was stereotypical. I jumped with my eyes wide open as the phone vibrated in my pocket. It would have been funny if Darlene had said something to the effect of &#8220;Hi Darlin&#8217; is that a cell phone in your pocket or are you just glad to see me.&#8221; </p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1217.html" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
