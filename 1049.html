	<p>[<b>blogger&#8217;s note</b>: Here&#8217;s Darlene&#8217;s take on the night before Iraq&#8217;s so-called election.]</p>

	<p>I have heard a lot of awful news coming out of Iraq lately.  The story of the station wagon with an entire family inside who for some reason (perhaps didn&#8217;t hear the soldiers shout) didn&#8217;t stop immediately at a checkpoint and the parents in the front seat were killed. Don&#8217;t know if any of you saw the photo of the young girl covered in her parents&#8217; blood.  A horrible thing, war.  This is a very real result of it.  I have read estimates that up to 100,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed since this began.  The destruction of cities is rampant as well. Even in Bagdad they do not yet have reliable electricity and water.</p>

	<p>Tomorrow the Iraqis are to vote in elections.  Our president says he anticipates &#8220;a grand moment in Iraqi&#8217;s history.&#8221;  But the situation is hardly ideal.  Insurgents have been blowing up polling places, election workers are being killed, and the populace is faced with the choice of risking their lives to cast a ballot.  (often being threatened to be killed if they do and if they do not go to the polls) And many Iraqis see themselves as living in an occupied country.</p>

	<p>I am fearful of what may occur tomorrow to the Iraqi citizens, to our soldiers, and to the innocent children who are so often caught in the crossfire.  Our president has been urging the Iraqis to vote.  I feel he is so bent on making a name for himself in history that he has put himself and his agenda above the safety of the countless soldiers and citizens in danger.  Make no mistake, Iraq is a war zone, and many sections of Iraq are NOT in control of the soldier or the interim Iraqi government. [<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/27/international/middleeast/27baghdad.html?pagewanted=all&#38;position=">Across Bagdad, Security is Only an Ideal</a>] This was easily shown by the bombing of the American embassy today. While free elections sounds like a wonderful goal, it is unconscionable to risk the lives of so many in a country where so many other basic needs are left unmet.</p>

	<p>May we all pray that tomorrow is not a nightmare as those polling places open.  The U.S. has enough blood on it&#8217;s hands.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1217.html" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
