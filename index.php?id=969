	<p>Snippets from life, the universe and everything&#8230;</p>

	<p>I went with our assistant director to a couple of festivals on Saturday to talk up the library. In the afternoon we watched the longest continuous Pony Express Run in the nation run at the Canaan Fall Festival. We then spent the evening listening to a mariachi band at Fiesta Latina. [<b>update</b>: <a href="http://cards.webshots.com/cp-85868742-GChc-album/186867416ASTayc">festival photos</a>)</p>

	<p>It was good to get out of the library because it&#8217;s been hot as hell in there the last few days. Our contractor cut off our air conditioning to install new units and it was easily in the upper-80s in the library. I worked in it Sunday afternoon and if it wasn&#8217;t for the fans we would have just died. Fortunately, they hooked it back up this afternoon so I am hoping tomorrow will be better.</p>

	<p>Also, after a summer worth of probably unneccessary wrangling with computer consultants, I&#8217;ve chosen someone to do the wireless internet project at the library. I&#8217;m enjoying high-speed wireless at home and it&#8217;ll be great to have it at the library for anyone to use.</p>

	<p>Mind you, after last week, I think anyone would agree that our library is a &#8220;hot spot.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Darlene&#8217;s got pots everywhere in her studio and is trying to get them through the kiln in time for the <a href="http://www.madisonchautauqua.com/">Madison Chautauqua</a>. She figures she&#8217;ll get seven more glaze loads through which is pretty good.</p>

	<p>We had a scare as her kiln couldn&#8217;t make it to 2200F and shut itself down. Turns out the lid is getting a little warped and we&#8217;re losing too much heat out the top. She put a brick on the lid to hold the seal and that was enough to do the trick. This evening she pulled out a very nice load of pots. Very rich glazes came out o f the kiln. Some new kiln bricks on top should do the trick.</p>

	<p>Sunday morning, I felt my first earthquake ever. This one was 95 miles away, but I was just the right place to feel it&#8212;on our third floor bathroom toilet (sigh&#8230; what timing). If I hadn&#8217;t been on such a solid surface high up in an antique brick building I doubt I would have noticed. I wasn&#8217;t able to confirm my assumed hallucination until that evening when I checked the <a href="http://pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/shake/STORE/Xnhad_04/ciim_display.html">earthquake</a> center website to see a 3.6 hit near Shelbyville, Indiana.</p>

	<p>Studying for the GRE is oddly a nice diversion from politics. My math is improving and I think I&#8217;ll be able to hit my goal of a 600 on the section (I need a minimum of 500). I&#8217;m learning that getting problems right in practice and right in a testing situation are two different things. In an untimed practice I got 52/60 questions right. On a timed test this evening I got 18/28. (To compare the two fractions, multiply the denominators and cross multiply for the numerators). I just need to make sure I write it all down. It&#8217;s very easy to miss details when you&#8217;re trying to rush it. Quick which is greater? The arithmatic mean of 7, 3, 5, 1 or the mean of 2a-5, 4a, 7-6a?</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ll find out on Friday if I&#8217;ve picked up enough speed and remembered all the formulas. Fortunately, I have Thursday off for last minute studying. By the way, the two are equal.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" href="http://www.ontheriversedge.com/index.php?id=1217" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
