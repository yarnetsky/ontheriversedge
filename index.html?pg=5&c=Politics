  	<p>My mom visited us just before the holiday and brought us an Alice in Wonderland mug that had a disappearing Cheshire cat when you put in hot water. The mug is great (it doesn&#8217;t hurt that I love the Sir John Tenniel&#8217;s illustrations).</p>

	<p>Today I stumbled upon another product from the Unemployed Philosphers Guild: the <a title="Unemployed Philosophers Guild: Lost Civil Liberties mug" href="http://www.philosophersguild.com/index.lasso?page_mode=Product_Detail&#38;item=0236">Lost Civil Liberties mug</a>.</p>

	<p>Amazing how a cup of coffee can share such truths.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>If you like public television or public radio, now is the time to act as the House of Representatives is planning to slash the budget. <a href="www.moveon.org">MoveOn.org</a> is rallying to protect PBS and NPR from budget cuts through a petition on which they hope to get 1 million signatures.</p>

	<p>When I was attending college at Miami University, I worked in the news department of the public radio station WMUB. The experience was by far the best journalism experience I ever had. When I found a story, they gave me the air time to tell it right. You just can&#8217;t find that anywhere else on the radio dial.</p>

	<p>Why do I favor public funding for NPR? Radio media today is highly consolidated supported by and subservient to its advertisers. There are certainly a number of really good stations that don&#8217;t let ad dollars interfere with its reporting, but if you want news that serves you public radio is the place to get it.</p>

	<p>PBS speaks for itself as the number of kids who have learned courtesies and their letters and numbers from Seseme St. is incalculable. Schools across the nation use PBS programming in their lesson plans.</p>

	<p>The bottom line is this is valuable to me. I believe it makes our communities stronger. I encourage you to sign this <a href="http://www.moveon.org">petition</a>. It should be the top link on the page.</p>

	<p><b>Sidenote</b>: These kinds of cuts were considered in 1995 and a similar petition was circulated. However, once the threat subsided, the petition continued to circulate and it was soon labeled as a hoax. However, this is real and the vote will take place in the next few days. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m linking only to the homepage of Moveon.org. If the petition is not the top link on the page, it&#8217;s too late for this round.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>Here&#8217;s a recent quote from Howard Dean&#8230;<br />
<blockquote><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2005/06/07/MNdean07.TMP">(Dean) said in San Francisco this week</a> that Republicans are &#8220;a pretty monolithic party. They all behave the same. They all look the same. It&#8217;s pretty much a white Christian party.&#8221;</p>

	<p>&#8220;The Republicans are not very friendly to different kinds of people,&#8221; Dean said Monday, responding to a question about diversity during a forum with minority leaders and journalists. &#8220;We&#8217;re more welcoming to different folks, because that&#8217;s the type of people we are. But that&#8217;s not enough. We do have to deliver on things: jobs and housing and business opportunities.&#8221;<br />
</blockquote></p>

	<p>In the past couple of days a number of Democratic elected officials and leaders have growled at Dean for the statement. In part because all that is being reported is that Dean said Republicans &#8220;are pretty much a white Christian party.&#8221;</p>

	<p>If Dean made a mistake here it was possibly leaving out the word &#8220;leadership&#8221; after Republican, because that&#8217;s who he&#8217;s talking about.</p>

	<p>Consider this. &#8220;Of the 3,643 Republicans serving in the state legislatures, <a href="http://americablog.blogspot.com/2005/06/oops-gop-really-is-all-white-study.html">only 44 are minorities</a>, or 1.2 percent.&#8221; White? Yes. Is the Christian right driving the Republican social policy? Yes.</p>

	<p>The truth is that the GOP is run by the Christian right on social issues and by corporate libertarians on economic issues. These people don&#8217;t want a &#8220;voice&#8221; in a democrary. They don&#8217;t even want to be the majority in a democracy. They want to rule&#8212;lock, stock and barrel.</p>

	<p>I give Dean tons of credit for trying to tell people we are heading toward a plutocratic theocracy&#8212;one that is oddly unChrist-like.</p>

	<p>Yet, we are in a time where this political truth telling can get your head chopped off by the GOP machine and the Democratic leadership is still clearly afraid of this buzz saw. If we can&#8217;t find a way of telling America the political truth of what we face, how can we possibly win in 2006 or ever?</p>

	<p>So to the Democratic leaders who are chewing on Dean I have this to say&#8230; if you don&#8217;t like hearing Dean tell the truth, you better figure a better way of doing it yourself.</p>

	<p><b>Afterword</b>: I did read an article that the D.C. Democratic gang is angry because Dean is ignoring the Democratic corporate fatcats when it comes to fundraising.</p>

	<p>Dean is actually doing an awesome job of raising money&#8212;we&#8217;re nearly doubling our off-year fundraising records (though Republicans are still outraising us 2:1). However, most of this money is being raised through small donations and, to make it worse (to insiders eyes), the money is being given to state parties.</p>

	<p>This is actually genius because it is at the state level that the Democrats are having the most luck and that can only ripple into the national ranks. Yet, the Washington establishment appears to be flinching at the notion and a few people are wondering if this isn&#8217;t a reason the establishment wants to take out Dean.</p>

  	<p>This is ugly.. really ugly. (But stay tuned to the end, because I&#8217;ll toss in a cute aside to make up for the pain)...</p>

	<p>The American Civil Liberties Union is reporting that the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is planning to vote on a greatly expanded Patriot Act. The kicker, they&#8217;re allegedly going to do this in a closed secret meeting.</p>

	<p>That alone is anti-democracy, but it&#8217;s no wonder they are doing it behind closed doors&#8212;the bill is outright scary. Here&#8217;s the part that gauls me as a future librarian&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>The bill would grant so-called &#8220;administrative subpoena&#8221; authority to the FBI, letting the bureau write and approve its own search orders for any tangible thing it deems relevant to an intelligence investigation without approval. This power would let agents seize personal records from medical facilities, libraries, hotels, gun dealers, banks and any other business, without having to appear before a judge, and without any evidence that the people whose records are swept in are involved in any criminal activity.</blockquote></p>

	<p>Without any checks whatsoever, we might as well rename the FBI the KGB.</p>

	<p>Here are some ACLU links:</p>

	<p><b>Now for the cute that I promised</b>... We have workgroups in my library management class and my teammate Elsa sent me a link for <a href="http://www.storewars.org">Store Wars</a>. It&#8217;s a very smart and timely parody of the original Star Wars comparing organic foods to your usual grocery aisle goods. It&#8217;s cute as a cucumber&#8230;</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>In the days prior to homework I&#8217;d have known about the filibuster deal immediately. Instead I learned about it nearly four hours later&#8230; I&#8217;m slipping.</p>

	<p>In the world that the Senate should be and has been practiced for umpteen decades, there wouldn&#8217;t be a question about the filibuster. Both parties have used it to keep the wingers out of posts. The filibuster is honorable and a sound way of protecting the minority voice in the Senate. A filibuster allows for individuals in the august body to have their say, yet also puts their entire party on the line.</p>

	<p>If the Repugs wanted to pick on rules to change&#8212;it should be the committee chairman that won&#8217;t even bring a nomination before their committtee. The difference is one person blocking a process versus 40+ senators blocking a process.</p>

	<p>The Democrats should not have had to make a compromise on such a basic tradition. Yet, when you&#8217;re down by 10 votes and the right wingers are hellbent for domination you do what you can do to survive until the next election and hope that one&#8217;s not fixed.</p>

	<p>Still, what president has EVER had 95 percent of their appointees approved? What president or party has EVER had the gaul to assume they&#8217;d get 100 percent approval?</p>

<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1088.html" title="A new morality for the 21st century?"> A new morality for the 21st century?</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>For my library management class I&#8217;m reading an interesting book called &#8220;Civic Librarianship&#8221; by Ronald B. McCabe.</p>

	<p>McCabe argues that the libertarian trends of the 60s-mid 90s created a nation where communities and civic institutions have been reduced to business models with no moral authority to help society. Libraries, schools and newspapers, for examples, are no longer educators and protectors of our civic society, but simple purveyors of information.</p>

	<p>This in turn causes management and the public to devalue the civic professionals such as teachers, librarians and journalists. The library world is screaming at these trends&#8212;Philadelphia, for example, has been planning to reduce numerous branches to &#8220;express libraries&#8221; staffed only with paraprofessionals. The reasoning? Who needs professional librarians in a world where libraries are becoming nothing more than glorified bookstores?</p>

	<p>McCabe argues this trend started in the 1960s when counter-culture rebeled against the &#8220;moral&#8221; authority of authority. In the 1980s, the right joined in on the fun and tossed in an economic libertariansim that not only eliminated much of the moral checks and balances of business, but in turn forced civic institutions to follow business-oriented models of operation.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m just under half way through the book so I haven&#8217;t read too many of his &#8220;solutions,&#8221; but it revolves around the notion that society needs to regain it&#8217;s shared &#8220;morality&#8221; that emphasizes a balance between rights and responsiblities&#8212;both socially and economic.</p>

	<p>I admit that when it comes to talk of &#8220;morality,&#8221; my fears ask the question &#8220;whose morality?&#8221; Nonetheless, I think he is correct.</p>

	<p>He uses another author&#8217;s analogy of society as a mosiac. The pieces are all individual and that individuality is not lost. However, there is a frame and a glue that keep the pieces together and creates something bigger than the pieces. The glue is &#8220;shared&#8221; morality and the frame is community.</p>

	<p>This all makes good sense, but the key is obviously the word &#8220;shared.&#8221; While there are indeed morals the supermajority of the public could agree on, we are now in a climate where some of the shards would rather cut us than become a part of the mosiac.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ll follow up when I read more of the book. I&#8217;m curious how the &#8220;community movement&#8221; could equal a new &#8220;civic librarianship.&#8221; </p>
