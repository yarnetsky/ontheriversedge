<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1237.html" title="Sodrel-Hill polls are now in..."> Sodrel-Hill polls are now in...</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>Labor Day has come and gone and I was getting curious about how our local congressional race was going&#8212;especially as I live in Indiana&#8217;s 9th, one of the hotest races in the country.</p>
	<p>Just as this thought crossed my mind this week, two polls came out showing former Congressman Baron Hill leading in his bid to reclaim his seat from Republican Mike Sodrel. Sodrel won the seat in 2004 by 1,500 votes.</p>
	<p>The first poll was from the independent firm Research 2000 who showed <a href="http://www.research2000.us/2006/09/13/democrat-hill-with-lead-over-gops-sodrel/">Hill up 46-40</a>.<br />
This poll was conducted just after Labor Day (Sept. 5-8) is among likely voters and a margin of error of 4.9%.</p>
	<p>Another poll, conducted Sept. 8-10, is much more optimistic about Hill&#8217;s chances. Constituent Dynamics polled <a href="http://www.constituentdynamics.com/mw/2006/">30 hot races</a> and their results found Hill current favored 53-42 with only a 3% margin of error. This race showed Sodrel doing well in our part of the district, but losing badly in Bloomington (no surprise) and the western part of IN-9.</p>
	<p>I&#8217;m living a sheltered life at the moment and Madison has yet entered the election frenzy. As such, I have little gut instinct on our local race other than I&#8217;d suspect it is closer than 11 points.</p>

<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1236.html" title="iTunes 7... Eureka!"> iTunes 7... Eureka!</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>Two recommendations in one.</p>
	<p>First download Apple&#8217;s new version of <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes">iTunes</a>. The fit and finish in this new version is quite good. First, they integrated cover art downloading for <strong>any</strong> CD (not just the ones you purchase from the iTunes Store). You can then &#8220;flip&#8221; through the images like you would flip through your CD cases in a drawer. It&#8217;s pretty slick.</p>
	<p>Also, they upgraded the content on the iTunes Store. Yes, they&#8217;re now selling Disney movies, but equally importantly is they have upgraded the television shows. The width increased from 320 to 640 pixels wide which, with their latest codec, looks very good blown up to full screen on my laptop&#8212;close but not quite DVD quality. I&#8217;d be interested how it looked on a TV screen.</p>
	<p>My iTunes test drive was the pilot for Sci-Fi network&#8217;s new show <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewTVSeason?id=185836174&#38;s=143441">Eureka</a> (this link will open up iTunes). That is my second recommendation. The acting is good and the  story line is quirky and you can&#8217;t beat the price&#8212;free. I&#8217;m sold on the show and it will take some self control to not immediately buy the season.</p>
	<p>In a nutshell, a U.S. Marshal transporting a young woman to L.A. gets lost and stumbles across a secret town where America&#8217;s scientific geniuses are socked away to live, work and sleep science. Instantly he is sucked into an investigation of missing boy that is really a question of space-time disintegration. </p>
	<p>My favorite description of the show is that it&#8217;s a twist between Twin Peaks, Star Trek and the Andy Griffith Show.</p>

<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1233.html" title="Pretty nasty fire in downtown Madison"> Pretty nasty fire in downtown Madison</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>I honestly don&#8217;t feel like blogging about the <a href="http://www.madisoncourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=4&#38;SubSectionID=253&#38;ArticleID=31760">fire that gutted our 104-year-old Elks Lodge</a> here yesterday. </p>
	<p>On one hand, it makes me sick to see any of our beautiful buildings damaged by fire. On the other I&#8217;m glad our fire fighters were able to contain the blaze to the buildings it did. I find it strange to be glad that it wasn&#8217;t worse when it was awful to begin with.</p>
	<p>In all I think four structures were heavily damaged or gutted. Next door the old City Hall building was in better shape, but that&#8217;s not saying much with the roof largely gone and all the elaborate tin cornice work literally melted off the side of the building. <br />
Two houses behind the Elks were also heavily damaged. </p>
	<p>Today they announced the <a href="http://www.madisoncourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=4&#38;SubSectionID=253&#38;ArticleID=31775">cause was a bad light ballast</a> in the basement of the Elks.</p>
	<p>I talked with the Elk&#8217;s ruler today and he said they hope to salvage the shell of the building. However, they won&#8217;t know what is even possible until they get engineers on site. </p>
	<p><a href="http://madisoncourier.mycapture.com/mycapture/folder.asp?event=164652">The Madison Courier has photos.</a></p>
	<p>These buildings are not quite as old as others downtown. The Elk&#8217;s Lodge was built around 1902 and <a href="http://madison-jeffco.cdmhost.com/cgi-bin/viewer.exe?CISOROOT=/p4038coll5&#38;CISOPTR=26">the old City Hall c.1880</a> I believe. Thus the brickwork may have survived better than some of the older buildings with softer brick. However, reproducing the tin work could take a chunk of cash and that is what I fear will be forever lost. There was a bad fire on Main Street maybe 9 years ago and the cornice has yet to be rebuilt. The homes around the corner were from the 1830s, but other than knowing the roof was about to cave in, I don&#8217;t know their condition.</p>
	<p>News of the fire got around fast, but they did not describe well where the fire was located. Thus calls to town were flying. Some good friends who had just bought a building here called when they heard about the fire on Indianapolis radio. People were calling the library to see if we were open. </p>
	<p>Thus here&#8217;s the location. It was on West Street in the block north of Main. We live about four blocks to the southeast and the library is about four blocks west of this location.  (Click for an interactive map.)</p>
	<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#38;hl=en&#38;q=440+West+St,+Madison,+Indiana&#38;ie=UTF8&#38;z=15&#38;ll=38.738151,-85.380077&#38;spn=0.014227,0.037766&#38;om=1&#38;iwloc=A"><img src="/images/50.jpg" alt="location of fire in downtown Madison" style="height:222px;width:345px" border="0" /></a></p>
	<p>I took some photos this afternoon for the library archives and I&#8217;ll post a few later.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>OK, so we&#8217;re now down to eight planets. The astronomers finally kicked our solar system&#8217;s odd-ball out of the house. But did they have to go as far as <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/content/article/2006/08/24/pluto935.html">calling Pluto a dwarf?</a></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Leading astronomers declared Thursday that Pluto is no longer a planet under historic new guidelines that downsize the solar system from nine planets to eight &#8230; Instead, it will be reclassified in a new category of &#8220;dwarf planets,&#8221; similar to what long have been termed &#8220;minor planets.&#8221; The definition also lays out a third class of lesser objects that orbit the sun&#8212;&#8220;small solar system bodies,&#8221; a term that will apply to numerous asteroids, comets and other natural satellites.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>It just seems so demeaning. It&#8217;s not about political correctness. I just feel bad for the Plutonian people. They&#8217;re now like the residents of the District of Columbia. They live in the solar system and pay taxes in the solar system, but they don&#8217;t get representation.</p>

  	<p>My opportunity for futzing with my website is coming to an end. My online class starts Wednesday, Darlene has some appointments and sinus surgery coming up this week and I have class on Friday in Indy. Thus, no more futzing.</p>
	<p>Either way, my latest futz is a new photo page that falls within the template of the overall blog. Before the galleries were off site. I&#8217;m not <em>entirely</em> happy with the results, but it&#8217;s not bad. Creating the gallery is simple. The photos, on the other hand, take forever to prep. I&#8217;m just thinking there is an easier way of doing it.</p>
	<p>The first two galleries are from a recent weekend getaway to New Harmony, Indiana.</p>
	<p>So why are you still here? Go over to my new <a href="/?s=photos">photo page</a>.</p>

  	<p>Yes, you&#8217;re still on the river&#8217;s edge, I&#8217;ve just been messing around with the colors. </p>
	<p>I&#8217;m definitely not done, but I like the concept. I&#8217;d like to give the background more depth and the text colors need work.</p>
	<p>That said, what do you think so far? Yes, you may say &#8220;the design is so 2001&#8221; or other such slams. </p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>It makes sense, Stern said, that there could be dozens of planets in the solar system. The discoveries in the Kuiper Belt have put Pluto in context, he said. &#8220;Pluto is no longer the misfit,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is closer to average than the Earth.&#8221;</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>The news sent real estate prices skyrocketing on the eight major planets as Solians moved en mass trying to avoid the  stigma of living on a pluton. </p>
	<p>One buyer moved from Ceres to Mars after his Martian friends taunted him. &#8220;Before we were the king of the asteriod belt, now we&#8217;re a measly pluton. My friends harassed me saying I was nothing more than a backwater pluton hick. It was awful. I&#8217;ll miss Ceres, I so much liked small planet life.&#8221; </p>
