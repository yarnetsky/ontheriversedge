<div class="entry">


     

  	<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is a post from my wife Darlene.</p>
	<p>I, like many, have been following the stories from the areas that were hit by hurricane Katrina.  Recently I read a story telling of bodies still &#8211; 6 months later &#8211; being found in houses in New Orleans.  Another story in the past few weeks told of evacuees still waiting for promised FEMA trailers.  This nightmare is not over for many.  </p>
	<p>About four days before hurricane Katrina, I visited the website of the New Orleans newspaper, the <a href="http://www.nola.com">Times-Picayune</a>.  There I found a series of articles published in 2002 that is still online.  The topic?  Titled <a href="http://www.nola.com/hurricane/?/washingaway/">Washing Away</a>, the series was an in-depth depiction of the consequences of a major hurricane hitting New Orleans. It was all there, the failing of the levees, the storm surge predictions, the history of hurricanes that have hit the area in the past, the lack of transportation available for residents to evacuate. The series showed in detail, complete with graphics, the likelihood of a major hurricane hitting New Orleans, and the probable results.</p>
	<p>As the newspaper put it:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>It&#8217;s a matter of when, not if. Eventually a major hurricane will hit New Orleans head on, instead of being just a close call. It&#8217;s happened before and it&#8217;ll happen again.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>As a city that is located below sea level, the dangers were obvious, and the &#8220;big one&#8221; was an ongoing topic in the area, much as Californians await the big earthquake.  Early in 2005, the National Weather Service predicted a busier hurricane season than usual with a number of strong storms. Hurricane Katrina moved into the gulf on Friday August 26th, 3 days before coming ashore in the US for the second time. As it passed through southern Florida, the predictions of it becoming a major hurricane fueled by the perfect conditions in the warm gulf began:</p>
	<p>From the National Hurricane center on the 26th:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>GIVEN THE RAPID IMPROVEMENT IN THE INNER CORE STRUCTURE AND THE SHARP PRESSURE DROP&#8230;RAPID INTENSIFICATION SEEMS LIKELY FOR THE NEXT 12 HOURS OR SO. AFTERWARDS&#8230;STEADY INTENSIFICATION TO NEAR CATEGORY FOUR STRENGTH BY 72 HOURS APPEARS TO BE IN ORDER GIVEN THE VERY WARM GULF WATERS BENEATH THE HURRICANE AND THE VERTICAL SHEAR FORECAST TO DECREASE TO LESS THAN 10 KT BY 48 HOURS.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>The warnings put out by the National Weather Service were detailed and ominous.</p>
	<p>This from Sunday the 28th&#8230;</p>
 <blockquote> MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS ARE NEAR 160 MPH&#8230;WITH HIGHER GUSTS. KATRINA IS A POTENTIALLY CATASTROPHIC CATEGORY FIVE HURRICANE ON THE SAFFIR-SIMPSON SCALE. SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN STRENGTH ARE LIKELY PRIOR TO LANDFALL&#8230;AND KATRINA IS EXPECTED TO MAKE LANDFALL AT CATEGORY FOUR OR FIVE INTENSITY. WINDS AFFECTING THE UPPER FLOORS OF HIGH-RISE BUILDINGS WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY STRONGER THAN THOSE NEAR GROUND LEVEL.
	<p>KATRINA IS A LARGE HURRICANE.  HURRICANE FORCE WINDS EXTEND OUTWARD UP TO 105 MILES FROM THE CENTER&#8230;AND TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS EXTEND OUTWARD UP TO 230 MILES.  SUSTAINED TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS ARE ALREADY OCCURRING OVER THE SOUTHEAST LOUISIANA COAST.  </p>
	<p>A NOAA HURRICANE HUNTER PLANE REPORTED A MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 904 MB&#8230;26.69 INCHES.</p>
	<p>COASTAL STORM SURGE FLOODING OF 18 TO 22 FEET ABOVE NORMAL TIDE LEVELS&#8230;LOCALLY AS HIGH AS 28 FEET&#8230;ALONG WITH LARGE AND DANGEROUS BATTERING WAVES&#8230;CAN BE EXPECTED NEAR AND TO THE EAST OF WHERE THE CENTER MAKES LANDFALL.  SOME LEVEES IN THE GREATER NEW ORLEANS AREA COULD BE OVERTOPPED.  SIGNIFICANT STORM SURGE FLOODING WILL OCCUR ELSEWHERE ALONG THE CENTRAL AND NORTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO COAST.</blockquote> </p>
	<p>So while our president said just days after the hurricane, that no one anticipated the levees would be breached, that was obviously not the case.</p>
	<p>Before I continue, let me make one thing clear.  Though I am no fan of President Bush, I am appalled at the hurricane response at all levels.  There is enough failure and blame to go around.  Why I am particularly disturbed by the comments of President Bush, however, is that this one comment shows a either a lack of awareness, an ignorance that is disturbing to see in our top leader, or it shows a callous disregard for the facts and the truth of the catastrophy that killed over a thousand of our citizens.</p>
	<p>I was extremely angry at the time to hear the reporting of the falsehood of no one anticipating the levees failing.  I still am, but the reports that were published by the Associated Press the other evening, and the video of the news conference clearly show that president Bush was informed- in detail &#8211; of the threat before the arrival of the hurricane.  Michael Brown, for all of his supposed failings clearly understood the danger facing New Orleans from the storm, and President Bush was warned by him and others  of what was coming.  </p>
	<p>If you haven&#8217;t already seen this on the news, it is posted by a number of news sources on the web.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content//video/2006/03/01/VI2006030101864.html">Link to video from the Washington Post</a></p>
	<p>This story and video was covered on all major news networks. FEMA and Homeland Security definitely need to be organized better and as I said earlier there is  enough blame to go around.  Because Katrina touched all of us and hurt so many of our people, I feel that we all need to be informed of what really happened in the  response.  We cannot stop a hurricane, but we can insist &#8211; from all of our leaders &#8211; on better care for our fellow citizens in need.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>I am 100 percent for religious freedom. This includes allowing our Indiana legislators to open their session with prayer.</p>
	<p>The key is that <em>everyone</em> should be able to enjoy the same freedom. People should be able to worship their God(s)-Godess(es)-Spirit(s) as they deem proper. The flip side to freedom of religion is that we cannot quash anyone else&#8217;s freedoms either.</p>
	<p>Benjamin Franklin had an interesting saying: “Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch.”</p>
	<p>We have heard the argument that the lambs are trying to force the wolves to go vegetarian&#8212;no public prayer anywhere!  A vegetarian wolf is certainly unrealistic. Yet, recently even the lamb expressing their desire not to be eaten has met with howling.</p>
	<p>For example, there is now a resolution before the the Missouri legislature <a href="http://www.kmov.com/topstories/stories/030206ccklrKmovreligionbill.7d361c3f.html">to name Christianity the state&#8217;s official majority religion</a>.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>The resolution would recognize &#8220;a Christian god,&#8221; and it would not protect minority religions, but &#8220;protect the majority&#8217;s right to express their religious beliefs. The resolution also recognizes that, &#8220;a greater power exists,&#8221; and only Christianity receives what the resolution calls, &#8220;justified recognition.&#8221;</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>In Kentucky, a county attorney and a church youth group has submitted surveys to legislators and candidates with a single question: <a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060303/NEWS0101/603030397/1008/NEWS01">Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior?</a></p>
	<p>On one hand a voter should be able to ask a legislator their views on any topic and use that information in exercising their lobbying efforts or voting. Yet on the flip side the U.S. Constitution specifically states: &#8220;No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust.&#8221; Again, an interesting balance.</p>
	<p>To me it is specifically that&#8230;a balance. </p>
	<p>Let&#8217;s say a public school teacher were to offer up a prayer in class. In my mind any and all others in the school should be able to have the exact same freedom. Everyone would probably agree until one child or teacher wanted to offer a Wiccan prayer. Then all hell would break lose even though the last 42 prayers were Christian. So 42 people are allowed religious freedom and one does not?</p>
	<p>My personal preference would be to let everyone have their moments of prayer throughout the day as they desire so long as it did not interfer with classtime. Groups of Christian, Muslim, Jewish or Wiccan students could meet before school, between classes, during lunch or after school. 100 percent freedom and zero religious harassment.</p>
	<p>Yet, right now the wolves are howling that they don&#8217;t get to eat the lamb. I think this is obvious when you have legislative resolutions being proposed in a country with the Constitution states &#8220;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.&#8221; </p>
	<p>The levy between government and religion are crumbling. That might not be entirely bad if, unlike Hurricane Katrina, we actually evacuate everyone before the levy breaks.</p>
	<p>I may revisit and even revise these thoughts. It&#8217;s an interesting topic to think about. What are your thoughts?</p>

  	<p>Do you remember George W. Bush, four days after Hurricane Katrina absolutely swamped New Orleans stating: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees.&#8221; </p>
	<p>Well the Associated Press got ahold of a certain video and some transcripts today.</p>
	<p>Here&#8217;s a quote from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/01/politics/01cnd-katrina.html?_r=1&#38;oref=slogin">Video Shows Bush Was Warned Before Katrina</a></p>
 <blockquote>In dramatic and sometimes agonizing terms, federal disaster officials warned President Bush and his homeland security chief before Hurricane Katrina struck that the storm could breach levees, put lives at risk in New Orleans&#8217; Superdome and overwhelm rescuers, according to confidential video footage&#8230; Bush didn&#8217;t ask a single question during the final briefing before Katrina struck on Aug. 29, but he assured soon-to-be-battered state officials: &#8220;We are fully prepared.&#8221;</blockquote>
	<p>Bush is on tape. He knew. During the briefing Bush promised that the feds were ready and that help would be there. They were not.</p>
	<p>Why does he have to constantly lie about the sheer ineptness of his administration? I suspect his approval ratings would be a lot higher than 34 percent had he quickly acknowleged that FEMA became buried in a bureaucratic hell and that he would do everything in his power to correct it. </p>
	<p>Rather he told Brownie he was doing a &#8220;heck of a job&#8221; and lied that no one could have anticipated the breach. Typical,  how bushing typical.</p>
	<p>New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin has his share of the blame for the absolute disaster as well, but I can&#8217;t blame him at all for thinking this&#8230;</p>
 <blockquote>&#8220;I have kind a sinking feeling in my gut right now,&#8221; Nagin said. &#8220;I was listening to what people were saying&#8212;they didn&#8217;t know, so therefore it was an issue of a learning curve. You know, from this tape it looks like everybody was fully aware.&#8221;</blockquote>

If you stay tuned into the feed, it is followed by Ray Nagins comments and a pretty neat short about Mardi Gras.</p>

<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/index.php?id=1192" title="Curling men win bronze... I wish I could play"> Curling men win bronze... I wish I could play</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>Congrats to the American men&#8217;s curling team who <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/24/AR2006022400483_pf.html">pulled out a bronze medal</a> on the final throw of the match against Great Britain. The Americans had not placed in major competitions since 1978.</p>
	<p>Curling is a great sport that&#8217;s both social and extremely strategic. I like the description of &#8220;chess on ice.&#8221;</p>
	<p>I was lucky to play it when I was in college&#8212;I took it for my required phys.ed class. To this day I wish I could play it again.</p>
	<p>Indeed, it is probably the only sport I have ever done well at for more than one game. I had one good game of bowling (210) and one good game playing goalie in soccer (same game I broke my hand), but in curling worked for me. </p>
	<p>During the class I was the last of my team to try his hand at skipping, essentially directing the game strategy. Our team close to the basement of the class league, but when I took over and we started winning so we stopped rotating. We advanced to fourth place and squeaked into the playoffs. We actually made it to the championship game and had a chance to take the &#8220;gold&#8221; until the last end when the other team lined up their rocks just right and we couldn&#8217;t get into the target area inside their stones.</p>
	<p>Mind you, I think I was better at the strategy than sweeping so getting me out of that probably helped as well. Nonetheless, I &#8220;won a silver&#8221; out of a bunch of college kids learning to play curling.</p>
	<p>That&#8217;s the only sports hero story you will <strong>ever</strong> hear from me.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>If I have a junk food downfall, it is the potato chip&#8212;specifically kettle-cooked chips. </p>
	<p>My favorite brands have been <a href="https://webfeatsecured.com/MikeSells/ProductDetails.aspx?ID=3">Mike-Sells Old Fashioned</a> out of Dayton, Ohio, and <a href="http://www.capecodchips.com/classicchips.asp">Cape Cod Potato Chips</a> which are, yes, from Cape Cod (Hyannis&#8212;been there, ate that, yum). More recently I&#8217;ve found <a href="http://www.kettlefoods.com/index.php?cID=9">Kettle chips</a> from Salem, Oregon, to top both brands. It&#8217;s enjoyable to taste regional products.</p>
	<p>Like most everyone else though, I eat them with knowing guilt that I&#8217;m adding fat to my gut in the process.</p>
	<p>However, last week I had a revelation that my guilt could be reduced by as much as 65%. </p>
	<p>Kettle Foods has just released a new <a href="http://www.kettlefoods.com/index.php?cID=207">baked potato chip</a> and they are absolutely wonderful. Not only do they have 3g of fat as compared to 9g, but they are thick, crunchy and (hold onto your hats) taste like potato chips! </p>
	<p>They certainly don&#8217;t taste anything like the baked chips I&#8217;ve had before. Apparently those chips are made from compressed potato flakes. How do you make a compressed potato flake chip? The Kettle chips are made from actual unskinned Russets. I think it has something to do with the fact that Russets have more sugar in them than white potatoes that is making the product work for Kettle.</p>
	<p>Either way, I highly recommend them for anyone who is as chipper as I.</p>

  	<p>...Sometimes I wonder if <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/gallery/tv2/marvin.shtml">Marvin the Paranoid Android</a> had it right.</p>
	<p>This morning I had a dream I was on the phone arguing with the electric company over a $128,000 bill. &#8220;But I&#8217;m a librarian I only make xxx dollars a year!&#8221; (as if it would do any good explaining that.) They were charging me $60,000 because they were closing the Madison office of all things.</p>
	<p>I finally got mad (or madder rather) and hung up. I was panicking because I was running really late for work. I finally got to work and as I walked in my director said she needed to speak to me.</p>
	<p>At that moment the phone rang.  I woke up and realized I was indeed 30 minutes late for work as I had forgotten to turn on the alarm clock. I listened to the answering machine and it was a bill collector.</p>
	<p>I can understand dreaming about being late for work, but should I really be anticipating the call of a bill collector?</p>
	<p>That said, life has interceded and I admit I have not felt the urge to blog for the past few weeks. Basically, as Walt Crawford noted: <a href="http://cites.boisestate.edu/v5i13a.htm">Life Trumps Blogging</a></p>
	<p><strong>Life&#8230; not necessarily in this order&#8230;</strong></p>
	<p>1. My better half hasn&#8217;t been feeling well the last few months and we&#8217;re trying to figure out how to get her back to her usual self. She&#8217;s going on her fourth specialist so far with no diagnosis. It was a bill collector for the hospital that called this morning. They&#8217;re helping us try to figure out what we actually owe them as their billing system sucks.</p>
	<p>2. Life is hectic at the library and I&#8217;m trying to avoid the feeling of drowning because I took off time to be with Darlene (I&#8217;m slowly catching up again&#8230; I think).</p>
	<p>3. Classes started up again. I&#8217;m taking &#8220;Materials for children and young adults&#8221; and &#8220;Evaluation of Library Sources and Services.&#8221; Because of parts one and two (specifically part one), I&#8217;m not quite into the spirit of non-stop studying though the classes are interesting. Nonetheless, my 4.0 will most likely bite the dust this semester. I know that&#8217;s not really a bad thing as very, very, very few people ever care or check. Nonetheless, the concept is taking me a little bit of effort to accept.</p>
	<p>4. My mom got me <a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/index.php?id=1164">this amazing book</a> for my birthday (39 on 2-10) and it is sitting there taunting me to read it, but I really do need to read more of my homework. I&#8217;ve read many books already for the kiddie lit class (really good stuff!)</p>
	<p>Something will get me writing again. I&#8217;m sure George Bush is plotting his next stupid human trick right now just to get me blogging. Then again, some days there is so much stupidity that I give up trying to keep up with it all.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/index.php?id=1248" title="Permanent link to this article">Very interesting: Maps of War</a></h3>
	<p>Here&#8217;s a Flash film that provides a litte bit of <a href="http://www.mapsofwar.com/ind/imperial-history.html">history behind the Middle East</a> in 90 seconds.</p>

<div class="line"></div><h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/index.php?id=1247" title="Permanent link to this article">Arborgeddon</a></h3>
	<p><a href="http://www.buffalorising.com/slideshows/arbordeggon/slideshow.html">A photo slideshow from BuffaloRising.com</a>. The photos give you an idea of both how leafy and Victorian Buffalo is. This storm still boggles my mind. Madison here is also very leafy and I cannot imagine how much this city would change if we lost that many limbs and trees. I guess I&#8217;ll find out when I visit Buffalo next spring/summer.</p>

	<p>This poor person&#8217;s 4G iPod died <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sabellachan/237798173/in/pool-tuawrigs/">so she decided to give it a funeral</a>. Having lost three, yes three, 4G iPods (Apple finally gave me an iPod Photo and it works great), I find this hilarious.</p>

<div class="line"></div><h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/index.php?id=1217" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>
