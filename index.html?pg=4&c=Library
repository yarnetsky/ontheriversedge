  	<p>It&#8217;s a Friday at the library which is nice as I can get some work done.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ll be at the Jefferson County 4-H Fair next week with our assistant director and others representing the library. It could be fun. I created a game of Jefferson County trivia that I hope will be fun for people. I&#8217;m working on a simple Powerpoint presentation of some of the photos that&#8217;s in our <a href="http://madison-jeffco.cdm.oclc.org">photo history website.</a></p>

	<p>We&#8217;ll also have library puzzles for the kids. On one side is a puzzle and on the other side kids can draw a picture. We&#8217;ll then cut it into an 8-piece puzzle for them. Combine that with general info and I think we&#8217;ll be busy enough.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ll miss swimming though as I&#8217;ll probably be working 1-10 p.m. each day.</p>

	<p>A couple more entries and I&#8217;ll have hit 200. Hmmm. I&#8217;ll have to make sure it&#8217;s an interesting one.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>A paraphrased conversation at the Madison-Jefferson County Public Library this afternoon:</p>

	<p>&#8220;Did you order a bunch of CDs?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Just that order for 15 the other day.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;So you didn&#8217;t order 257&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Err, no.&#8221;</p>

	<p>After a heartbeat I remembered about the CD Settlement.</p>

	<p>Last year, the top CD distributers and retailers agreed to  <a title="Wired News: Few Takers for CD Settlement Cash" href="http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,57111,00.html">pay out more than $140 million in cash and CDs</a> to settle a lawsuit that charged they fixing music prices.</p>

	<p>As part of the deal, libraries would get a chunk of the proceeds. I expected maybe a couple dozen not couple dozen-dozen in six boxes.</p>

	<p>The titles cover the whole spectrum of music, many of which are out of print cast offs. Others though are pretty cool.</p>

	<p>I was pleased to see some jazz with Lionel Hampton and Thelonious Monk. The pop selection was so-so. Who really wants two CDs from 98 Degrees?</p>

	<p>Some of them we got two and three copies of such as Atlantic Records 50th Anniversary set.</p>

	<p>Last&#8212;and probably least&#8212;there was the &#8220;Martha Stewart&#8217;s Living: Spooky and Scary Sounds for Halloween.&#8221; Well, we do have a sound effects category, but I certainly would not have ordered it myself.</p>

	<p>Our cataloger was obviously floored. I promised to go through them and only have her do a couple dozen at a time.</p>

	<p>While I wouldn&#8217;t have bought half of them on my own, it will certainly have an impact on our collection.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;d be tempting not to buy another CD this year and roll the music money over into our budding, but hot DVD collection. But I can&#8217;t let the siren call from Norah Jones go unanswered.</p>

<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/915.html" title="Even cicadas like our library"> Even cicadas like our library</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>I&#8217;ve heard people call Brood X an invasion. The cicadas are definitely in full force here in Madison and we are inundated with the red-eyed, vainy-winged bugs.</p>

	<p>As the front door of our library opens, the buzz roars in and fades out as the door shuts once again.</p>

	<p>That&#8217;s been the scenario for the past 10 days. Today, however, I think the cicadas have finally realized what a cool library we have. They&#8217;re riding their way in on the backs of our patrons.</p>

	<p>This afternoon, a mom was checking out books as I was helping her daughter learn how to use Indiana&#8217;s Virtual Library <a href="http://www.inspire.net">Inspire.net</a>. Suddenly, we heard a very loud chirping from across the reading room. The young woman&#8217;s mother was jumping around clearly stunned. Soon, the poor woman realized there was a cicada in her purse.</p>

	<p>Not three minutes later, I&#8217;m still helping the student find journal articles on viruses and an older gentleman walked in and started chirping as well. As he found one in his pocket, the two of us couldn&#8217;t keep from laughing. He promptly dropped it on the floor and crunched it with his foot. Just what we needed, crushed cicada on our carpet.</p>

	<p>An hour later, I was checking out some videos for a young man who suddenly grabbed at his neck and found a cicada crawling down the collar of his shirt. Even knowing he had it in his hand we both jumped when the thing started chirping. Those puppies are loud.</p>

	<p>The buggers are falling from the trees, swarm at the lightest distraction and, unlike flies, know nothing of people, dogs, cars or anything else on earth for that matter. They&#8217;re all over the sidewalks and streets, many dead having been stomped on or driven over. I had a couple &#8220;riding&#8221; on my bike.</p>

	<p>They&#8217;re even showing public displays of affection.  I now regularly see pairs of cicadas on top of each. I was suddenly glad not to have children at this immediate point. Not only would I have to explain the birds and the bees, but cicadas as well.</p>

	<p>One of our patrons in this very boat said she was very happy when her kid readily settled for the answer of &#8220;they&#8217;re mating.&#8221; She&#8217;s not sure if the child knew what the word meant, but was happy to not have to explain it.</p>

	<p>While I&#8217;m glad we&#8217;ve visited by Brood X only once every 17 years, I&#8217;m enjoying the spectacle.</p>

	<p>This morning I went to the Hanover College library to pick up some inter-library loan books that were mis-routed seven miles in the wrong direction. Hanover is a very leafy campus and it was evident from the holes in the ground that there were a few million bugs along with the 2,000 students.</p>

	<p>The funny thing was the sound. There were so many of them that the overall aural feel of the cicada calls had changed. Instead of sounding like crickets on acid, the hum took on a whiring sound not unlike what you&#8217;d hear from space ships in 1950s sci-fi movies.</p>

	<p>Hmmm, maybe we are being invaded.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>Our library has been trying to get away from using our tech consultant as much this year, but it seems we&#8217;re instead using him more.</p>

	<p>Yesterday is a good example. We got sassed pretty bad by that Sasser.c worm. It started shutting down a couple of our computers on Saturday and Sunday and knocked out several more on Monday. I had updated many of our public access machines and OPACs with the latest patches after hearing of the lastest critical patch from Microsoft, but a few staff machines out of my domain had not been updated in a while and got hit.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, to &#8220;cure&#8221; the problem, the first thing was to insure the firewall was installed or installed properly. I know little about firewalls beyond how they work&#8230; so here comes the consultant again. Fortunately I was around when he came and I plumbed him for information&#8212;though I still don&#8217;t know about the mechanical firewall. He did suggest trying ZoneAlarm on our Windows2000 computers. I&#8217;m test driving it now.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, the computer we use for our pretty cool <a href="http://madison-jeffco.cdm.oclc.org">digitization project</a> has been on the fritz for weeks and, after several attempts, Gateway finally sent us the right parts. Apparently the panel that controls the hard drives went south.</p>

	<p>Finally, I need to send our wireless Internet project out for quotes as we want a pro to do the initial setup. We received a Library Services and Technology Act grant I wrote for the project and have just returned the paperwork to the state library.</p>

	<p>I sent my draft to the head of technology at the local college for a critique and I still haven&#8217;t heard back. I need to give him a call tomorrow. I&#8217;d hope to be started by now, but it&#8217;ll happen.</p>

	<p>Starting June 1, our building will be undergoing a massive building project to install and entirely new heating, air conditioning, ventilation system. Different parts of the building will be disrupted and the ability to move computers around at will would be nice to say the least.</p>

	<p>Dealing with technology is part of my job description, but after weeks like this I wonder if I should study computers as opposed to library science.</p>

  	<p>In today&#8217;s <a title="The Writer's Almanac - MARCH 8-14, 2004" href="http://www.writersalmanac.org/docs/04_03_08.htm#friday">Writer&#8217;s Almanac</a> by Garrison Keiler, it&#8217;s noted:</p>

	<p><blockquote>&#8220;On this day in 1901, industrialist Andrew Carnegie gave New York City 5.2 million dollars to construct sixty-five libraries.</p>

	<p>&#8220;He had just sold the Carnegie Steel Company to J. P. Morgan for 250 million dollars, and decided to retire and devote himself to giving it all away.</p>

	<p>&#8220;He later donated money to create more than 2,500 libraries all over the United States and Britain. By the time he died, Carnegie had given away over 350 million dollars.</p>

	<p>&#8220;He said, &#8220;The man who enters a library is in the best society this world affords; the good and the great welcome him, surround him, and humbly ask to be allowed to become his servants.&#8221;</blockquote></p>

  	<p>There was a group of teens in the library today joy riding in the elevator (real excitement in a small town I&#8217;m sure). I went around the library to make sure they weren&#8217;t hopping off in staff areas.</p>

	<p>I never found them, but down in the basement I found two other kids. One was sitting a book carts as the other was pushing him around down the non-fiction video aisle. Not that a 100 pounds of boy would do much damage, but it might violate our warrentee.</p>

	<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want us riding on this?&#8221; Good question.<br />
&#8220;No, it&#8217;s library property.&#8221;<br />
Poof they disappeared.</p>
