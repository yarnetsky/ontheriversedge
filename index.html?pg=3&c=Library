<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>Well, I went in for my noon to 9 p.m. shift and they were talking about closing early at 5 p.m. Then after lunch the director said, forget this, we&#8217;re closing at 2 p.m. So two hours and 15 minutes into my shift, I was home again.</p>

	<p>Depending on road conditions, they&#8217;ll probably be closed again tomorrow. We&#8217;re scheduled to be closed on Christmas Eve and Christmas. It will indeed be interesting on Sunday when I return. I suspect there will be a mountain of books to check in.</p>

	<p>As noted the National Weather Service was talking seven inches of snow. Now they&#8217;re talking 15 inches here in our little rivertown. At this pace, I wonder if we&#8217;ll manage to get out of here Friday to visit family for the holidays. It shouldn&#8217;t be too bad as it&#8217;ll stop snowing tomorrow. By Friday afternoon the roads should be OK, but we&#8217;ll check road conditions first.</p>

	<p>We&#8217;re trying to figure out what to do with our newfound time. I should probably clean our apartment, but the urge to take a nap is also alluring.</p>

	<p>A snow plow just came around the corner. Darlene, looking out the window&#8230; &#8220;Oooh, even the snowplows are skidding. Please don&#8217;t hit our van.&#8221; It didn&#8217;t.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s still snowing and life goes on.</p>

<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/index.html?id=979" title="In French, Chat. Chapeau."> In French, Chat. Chapeau.</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>I was in the back hall waiting for my cue. The sounds from the library auditorium echoed of sqeals and laughter. If it wasn&#8217;t so happy sounding, I&#8217;d wonder if a riot was taking place.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Lord, help me out here.&#8221; I beseeched as I wondered what I got myself into. I had volunteered to be the Cat in the Hat for a Cat in the Hat Party.</p>

	<p>I had taken photos of a Clifford party where &#8220;Clifford&#8221; interacted with 20 or so kids. I can deal with that. As the party date approached, I learned they had signed up 40 kids.</p>

	<p>When I walked into the auditorium, there were no 40 kids there. The place was absolutely packed. &#8220;Hmmm, I&#8217;m supposed to read Cat in the Hat to this crowd?&#8221;</p>

	<p>We played it just like the book. The librarian had to go get some craft materials so &#8220;the mom&#8221; wasn&#8217;t home when the cat arrived. I came in promising fun. We did &#8220;The Cat Says&#8221; did a Conga line and a pair of Thing One and Thing Two dolls &#8220;body surfed&#8221; through the crowd.</p>

	<p>I was out of things to do when I was finally rescued by the Librarian &#8220;coming home&#8221; and she asked me to read them the book.</p>

	<p>I sat down among the crowd and used my loudest voice to read the story. For the most part they paid good attention.</p>

	<p>From there the evening was a blur. I noticed things were a bit off kilter when a bunch of kids said they didn&#8217;t get the craft project. Didn&#8217;t get one??? We punted and gave away the gifts and cookies. Hey they even gave me a yo-yo too!</p>

	<p>Afterwards as we were cleaning up, I had kids hug me, a couple Japanese kids danced the cat dance with me and had my picture taken with kids which was fun. I got down on my knees as this 7-foot-tall cat would tower over the 4-foot-tall kids.</p>

	<p>Then I heard the kicker. One of our volunteers did a count as they were hearing a story. We had 76 kids show up for the party and that didn&#8217;t include the umpteen toddlers who came with their parents (or the parents themselves). We had well over 100 folks in the auditorium.</p>

	<p>Suffice it to say, I&#8217;m not sure I would have done it if I knew I&#8217;d be the Cat for more than 100 as opposed to my assumed 20. But it worked and I had a lot of fun. What can I say, I am enough of a ham to pull it off.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve always been a character. Now I know I can be a character.</p>

<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/index.html?id=974" title="My evening in the children&#8217;s room"> My evening in the children&#8217;s room</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>I worked tonight instead of my usual Wednesday as the children&#8217;s librarian went to a conference today.</p>

	<p>I helped some high school students with a project that seemed a little too broad (just about everything under the sun dealing with the turn of the 19th to 20th century from Mother Jones to inventions). I also shelved some books.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m always amazed how many cool children&#8217;s books there are in our library. I have no idea if the kids think they&#8217;re cool, but I do.</p>

	<p>Tonight I read easy readers about a Chinese girl celebrating the Fourth of July, a boy whose robot goes crazy when he should be in bed sleeping, a Jewish girl preparing for the sabbath dinner with her grandmother, about a young girl in Jim Crow Nashville discoving the library (the only integrated place in the city practically), and one illustrating blues lyrics.</p>

	<p>The latter two books were eye reopening. Certainly, I&#8217;ve read about what life was like under segregation. But the living the easy life of small-town America 2004, you forget the pain that was suffered. I never realized that Billie Holiday&#8217;s &#8220;Strange Fruit&#8221; referred to lynchings. I never heard the lyrics.</p>

	<p>After reading a children&#8217;s book (a children&#8217;s book!!!!), it leaves one wondering how one could ever forget.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Southern trees bear strange fruit,<br />
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root,<br />
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze,<br />
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.&#8221; </p>

<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/index.html?id=973" title="Speaking of geese or ducks actually&#8230;"> Speaking of geese or ducks actually&#8230;</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>I&#8217;ve finally gotten enough ducks in a row for grad school&#8212;though a few are still quacking and straggling behind.</p>

	<p>Today I plunked down my $50 and submitted my application to the Indiana University School of Library and Information Science.</p>

	<p>I still need to send them one of my transcripts. I ordered them, but somehow I have a bill of $106 at Bowling Green State University. I haven&#8217;t the foggiest how it got there as I had transferred to Miami University with no problem. The only thing Darlene can think of is she got a parking ticket driving a car in my name. Thus, no transcript. Go figure.</p>

	<p>Also I need to get my recommendations in, or rather herd my recommendations in. So far only one of people who agreed to be references has turned in their work. Another promised to finish it this week. I haven&#8217;t talked to the third. It&#8217;s actually a bit of work. There&#8217;s about a dozen questions to answer and an essay to write (up to 5000 characters). While I joke about herding ducks, I really appreciate their willingness to do so.</p>

	<p>I talked to the one gentleman who wrote me a reference. He is a retired academic library director who serves on our board. He is amazingly happy that I decided to pursue the profession and promised to be on my back until I finished the masters. I&#8217;ll take the encouragement where I can get it.</p>

	<p>I had known him for several years as a reporter. But, not long after I started at the library, I unknowingly helped out his father with some reference questions. He later told me that his father came home that day and really complimented the service. Ever since then he&#8217;s asked me every six months or so if I was planning to pursue an MLS.</p>

	<p>I suspect it goes a little further than that. Like myself, he stumbled across librarianship from another profession and found he enjoyed it. There are still so few men in the profession (I think I read 21%) that when a new one joins in, the current men rejoice?</p>

  	<p>Another entry from out &#8220;only at a library&#8221; collection&#8230;.</p>

	<p>One of our assistants was picking up stray papers near our photocopier and found the original of a cut and paste worksheet on sign language.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Huh, sign language, that&#8217;s cool. What in the&#8230;?&#8221; and she laughed her head off.</p>

	<p>It was more than a dozen signs all dealing with sex. Use your imagination as to what signs were on the sheet.</p>

	<p>No, I won&#8217;t be publishing the results.</p>

<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/index.html?id=938" title="Fair was a success"> Fair was a success</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>We survived the Jefferson County 4-H Fair in one piece. Other than needing to get the talking points out to everyone things worked rather well for our first time out.</p>

	<p>The biggest hit was our Accu-Cut puzzles. We printed out 4 per page flyers that said &#8220;Puzzled? Come to the Library for Answers.&#8221; We used that as a talking point with the kids and parents. We then had them drawing pictures on the back. I hammed it up with the kids. I had them say magical words &#8220;ugily, buggily, boo!&#8221; and roled the puzzle through the cutter &#8220;and poof, you have a puzzle.&#8221;</p>

	<p>However, I suspect that free-form drawing is becoming a lost art as a number of kids were dumbstruck with the concept. I continued hamming it up and made suggestions to get their brains going. &#8220;You can draw cars, balloons, sheep, horses, hearts&#8230; hey, you could even draw me!&#8221; pregnent pause. &#8220;No? I guess not.&#8221; They&#8217;d laugh and start drawing something. However, a mother-daughter combo actually took me up on the joke. That was even funnier.</p>

	<p>A few days later, Darlene ran into a mother who said her kids were <b>still</b> playing with the puzzles and were even making up games to play with them. So while kids drawing may be a lost art, creativity is not!</p>

	<p>I think we managed to have 300 folks doing puzzles over the week.</p>

	<p>Our drawing for free books and CDs was a general success as well. We drew 42 winners from more than 340 entries. About half of the winners had picked up their prizes when I left for Ohio yesterday.</p>

	<p>For prizes we used the duplicate CDs from the &#8220;CD price-fixing&#8221; settlement shipment we received earlier this summer. We also used a small number of the books donated to the library that we didn&#8217;t add to the collection.</p>

	<p>It was fun.</p>
