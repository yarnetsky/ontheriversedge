<![CDATA[<p>I used to deliver pizzas in college. I quickly learned my way around Bowling Green, Ohio, as well as any cop or ambulance driver.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s a grid city, 100 street number jumps for each block and even numbers are always on the right as you&#8217;re driving away from the center of town. Simple and, in the Midwest at least, you&#8217;ll rarely get lost using this system.</p>

	<p>Managua, Nicaragua, apparently has a very different system where up can easily mean down and vice-versa, there are no house numbers and there are no street names&#8212; <a href="http://www.worldpress.org/Americas/592.cfm">it&#8217;s a city of 2 million people without a map</a>.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p><a href="http://layertennis.com">Now this is a sport a design geek can appreciate</a>.</p>

	<p>Layer Tennis is a competition between designers. The first serves up a design to the second who must riff on the design to return the serve. The designs volley back and forth 10 times in the contest.</p>

	<p>The first match was a hoot with puns and twists galore. It was much more fun than watching real tennis&#8230;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Britain&#8217;s Daily Mail writes that <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=462091&#38;in_page_id=1770">children today have nowhere near the roaming range of their parents or grandparents</a>. </p>

	<p>The article&#8217;s conclusions are a tad mismatched to the premise, but this has always struck me as a trend that no one had noted. </p>

	<p>When I was a pre-teen, I remember wandering all over on my bike. My leash length varied depending on circumstances, but today even letting kids out of the house on their own seems to draw jeers of &#8220;how dare they let their child loose on the streets.&#8221; </p>

	<p>When I was a pre-teen, I used to bike a few miles away to the Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society. The librarian there would give me microfilm rolls of old Buffalo newspapers &#8212; solely for the purpose of reading old comic strips. </p>

	<p>Maybe I wasn&#8217;t as young as I remember &#8212; or maybe I was better behaved than I remember&#8212; but I don&#8217;t remember anyone ever giving me troubles because of my age like I see today.</p>

	<p>I wonder if kid leashes vary in length due to the fear, uncertainty and doubt in the given time. My mom told me her parents were reactionary in that regard&#8212; questioning even the need to walk outside (more or less). That was during the red scare 1950s.<br />
Is today terrorism, pedophiles and stupid drivers?</p>

	<p>I&#8217;d vote for care due to the stupid drivers around here, but is there really the need to lock up our kids? The kicker obviously is we&#8217;d have to teach our kids some street sense in the process (and put a gps phone in their pocket so we can follow their every move?)</p>

	<p>I don&#8217;t have kids so I can&#8217;t speak to what I&#8217;d do in reality, but I would have hated not being able to explore when I was a kid.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1756069.ece">The Times of London takes a look at the Kentucky Derby</a> as attended by the Queen of England.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>The Times ventured [into the infield] before the big race, struggling to make progress through an obstacle course of beer bellies. “This ain’t about racing over here,” one man, wearing more tattoos than clothes, said. “This is about drinking beer.” It was said with great affability, even courtesy. It is another difference between Kentucky and Ascot; no one, not even the course stewards and the policemen, are anything but polite and helpful. Even the drunks don’t, on the whole, cause offence. [sic]</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>I&#8217;m not surprised. Louisville is nothing if not a pleasing and polite city and the Derby is a celebration not a drunk night out. Of the eight metro areas within three hours of here, Louisville is definitely our favorite.</p>

	<p>Darlene and I do our picks for fun based entirely by horse name. Our favorite name this time, &#8220;Storm in May,&#8221; finished 16th I think. If I actually had to place a bet I&#8217;d probably have won some money as I liked Street Sense and Curlin, but I&#8217;ve never bet on horses and wonder if I ever will.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>If Buffalo wins the Stanley Cup, I suspect <a href="http://www.buffalonews.com/101/story/68680.html">last night&#8217;s cardiac win against the New York Rangers</a> will go down as the turning point. </p>

	<p>It&#8217;s not quite on par with the Boston Red Sox 9th-inning comeback against the Yankees in the 2004 <span class="caps">ALCS</span>, but it&#8217;s pretty darn close.</p>

	<p>The series was tied 2-2, but Rangers have been in the Sabres head the whole series. They took Buffalo out of their fast offensive game and their goalie, Henrik Lundqvist, has been amazing. </p>

	<p>Last night, the Sabres finally regained their offensive strength and rained 37 shots on Lundqvist, but they were still down 1-0. The Sabres have not been shutout all season, but they just couldn&#8217;t beat this guy. </p>

	<p>Thus, with the last seconds ticking off the clock, it looked like the Sabres were going to lose the whole amazing season. So when Chris Drury scored with only 7.7 seconds on the clock, the whole town went nuts. The lost hope was found and four minutes into overtime Max Afinogenov scored the biggest goal of his career for the win. </p>

	<p>I&#8217;m hours away from Buffalo, but from here it feels like the jinx is broken. The game makes me think of the John Cusack movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088794/">Better Off Dead</a> where Monique states &#8220;I think all you need is a small taste of success, and you will find it suits you.&#8221; (must see campy movie)</p>

	<p>The Sabres lost their taste of success in games 2 to 4, but I think they found it and boy does it suits them.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>The last few days I&#8217;ve been fighting the &#8220;Ohio Valley Crud.&#8221; At least that&#8217;s what they call any generally unidentifiable malady around here.  </p>

	<p>While in this snot-for-brains state, I fortunately stumbled across a listing of the 2007 <a href="http://www.comic-con.org/cci/cci_eisners_main.shtml">Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards nominees</a>.</p>

	<p>Thus, while fighting the crud, I became hooked on reading the nominees in the digital comics category. This was admittedly not a hard thing for me as I have loved comics since I was knee high to a wallaby (grasshoppers are too small).</p>

	<p>Nonetheless, I was amazed by the quality of the work. The story lines were addictive and the art is beautiful. Here are the nominees I&#8217;ve read so far&#8230;</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.beecomix.com">Motel Art Improvement Service</a> by Jason Little, features 18-year-old Bee who stumbles on this guy who goes from motel to motel secretly altering paintings on room walls. Little offers this strip to alternative newspapers as well, though I have never seen it in print.</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.girlgeniusonline.com">Girl Genius</a>, by Phil and Kaja Foglio, is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk">steampunk</a> at its geeky best. G.G. follows the wild adventures of Agatha Clay who is a &#8220;Spark&#8221; &#8212; essentially a talented mad scientist/engineer of very special lineage. This would be a great addition to Young Adult graphic novel collections as printed compilations are available.</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.kiwisbybeat.com/minusarchive.html">Minus</a>, by Ryan Armand, is about a young girl with magical powers. Minus is a neat character, but the real winner here is Armand&#8217;s artwork. Instead of using a computer graphics program, he hand watercolors his work and the results are wonderful.</p>

	<p>Finally, <a href="http://www.shootingwar.com">Shooting War</a>, by Anthony Lappe and Dan Goldman, takes place in 2011 during President McCain&#8217;s second term. A live-streaming video blogger accidentally films a terrorist attack and soon finds himself in Iraq covering the long war as a journalist for a 24/7 terrorism coverage news network.  The comic combines artwork with actual photographs for a real/surreal on-the-spot feel. Unfortunately, the online version is a huge tease for a graphic novel to be released this fall. I&#8217;ll have to buy it, so it was a very successful tease.</p>

	<p>For readers who only like their comics funny, note that Shooting War and Motel Art are edgier works that include violence, nudity and drug use.</p>

	<p>Other Eisner nominees include <a href="http://www.phables.com">Phables</a>, by Brad Guigar, and <a href="http://telltalegames.com/community/comics/samandmax/issue-3">Sam and Max</a>
 by Steve Purcell. However, I haven&#8217;t had a chance to read them yet.</p>

	<p>Finally, here&#8217;s a list of other digital comics I&#8217;ve recently enjoyed: 
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.wapsisquare.com/">Wapsi Square</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://questionablecontent.net/">Questionable Content</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://lackadaisy.foxprints.com/index.php">Lackadaisy</a>, </li>
		<li><a href="http://www.webcomicsnation.com/tylerpage/nb/series.php">Nothing Better</a> </li>
		<li><a href="http://www.boltcity.com/copper/">Copper</a>.</li>
	</ul></p>

	<p>If there are any digital comics you&#8217;d recommend, let me know. I always enjoy discovering a new cartoonist.</p>]]>
