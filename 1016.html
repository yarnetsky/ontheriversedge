	<p>Sometimes a movie gets so hyped or has so many expectations that it is absolutely ruined. Yet, if you don&#8217;t take them seriously they can still be a lot of fun.</p>

	<p>Topping that list was Twister. The first time I saw it, I found myself repeatedly taking it apart. A year later our old downtown theatre reopened after a multi-year closure and Twister was the grand opening film. We went to help the new owners celebrate. That night was wonderful, a) because the Ohio Theatre is wonderful, but b) because I realized Twister was a funny movie. The line &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to go, we&#8217;ve got cows&#8221; will stay forever etched in my mind.</p>

	<p>Well, when we heard TNT was produce an action-adventure flick called &#8220;The Librarian&#8221; everyone at our library was excited. Though I admit, most of my cohorts were interested because it starred Noah Wyle.</p>

	<p>Now I haven&#8217;t watched television (with occasional exceptions) for about a dozen years. We live in a 400-foot hole and we don&#8217;t have cable. Thus everyone saw it before I did. People said it was cheesy, they complained the protagonist wasn&#8217;t really a librarian. Heck, he never looked up an answer.</p>

	<p>So, when our director brought in a video from the premier and offered me first dibs, I went into with low expectations.</p>

	<p>Thank God I did because as a result I really enjoyed the movie. When you lower the bar, you can enjoy it for what it is&#8212;a recreation of the grade-B movies. You know&#8230; The Killer Tomato that Ate Madison and their ilk. Darlene and I laughed the whole time. It was aweful, but in such a delicious fashion. Heck, I want to watch a sequel.</p>

	<p>Heck, and any protagonist that can say, &#8220;but Mom, being a librarian is a pretty cool job,&#8221; can&#8217;t be all bad.</p>

	<p>If you want to catch <a href="http://www.tnt.tv/Title/View4/0,5878,543783|5929||||~~~,00.html">The LIbrarian: Quest for the Spear</a> you can watch it on TNT tonight <code> 11:45pm(ET), Sunday, Dec. 12th </code> 11:45pm, Saturday, Dec. 18th <code> 2pm and Sunday, Dece. 19th </code> 10am.</p>

	<p>Now I need to pass the video on to the next person in the library.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1217.html" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
