<p>    First of all these attacks were a surprise just like 9/11. Nobody knew Zarqawi was going to do this. However they did know he was capable of this, as is every other "dead ender". The Pentagon has sent a lot of wanted terrorist names to the NSC to investigate in the past few months. They can not follow every lead immediately. For if they did they would have to send more U.S. troops which would mean more of a risk for our soldiers. <br />
   If you can remember, in 2002 we were in the midst of attacking terrorist networks in Afghanistan. How can you stretch a military that has been drastically cut by 1/3 of its original size between N. Korea, Afghanistan, and now you say we should of attacked Iraq. But, the left says Bush is a liar and that there were no terrorist cells in Iraq, he is in there only for the oil. "No blood for oil." Sorry you can't have it both ways. At least now you recognize terrorist cells existed in Saddam's Iraq.   <br />
   Secondly, which was more important in June of 2002, getting Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban leadership or going after a minor figure like Zarqawi? Thirdly, who were the people demanding that a "case" be made against Saddam before we attack? Why it was the same group of people who cut our military for a "peace dividend." Why do you say now we should have attacked this group, yet tied the hands of this administration so that we had to continually jump through hurdles? Such as, getting a NEW U.N. resolution, making sure U.N. inspectors were there for Saddam’s WMD shell game, and focusing on building a Collation that pleases everyone (even the French.) Instead of unilaterally attacking, in response to this savage atrocity in 9/11. <br />
   To the socialist/liberal left, Bush is more evil then Osama, Saddam, and Zarqawi combined. But if they could think rationally instead of emotionally you can see from Bush's Radio Address >> <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/03/20040306.html">http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/03/20040306.html</a> &lt;&lt; that we did all we could do to warn of a potential attack that would pit the Shiites against the Sunnis. And the address is still optimistic for the future of the Iraqi people. Which again, is another difference between the left and the right. <br />
