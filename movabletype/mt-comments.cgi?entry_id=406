<div class="comments-body">
<p>I'm glad this seems like a breath of fresh air to you. Maybe it’s the election year allergies that have clogged the liberal minds of this nation. Because this smells like the same stuff they’ve been blowing for years. The first question, asked in the interview, John Edwards doesn’t even answer, other then "having the government involved" and more spending. And when an (independent) think tank disagrees with Edwards its branded "false", "not true", and "right-wing" he later clarifies that there is "no new government program" in Kerry's plan.  I am glad though that they found a "non-partisan" health economist like, former President Clinton advisor, Ken Thorpe to help. As far as the malpractice insurance cases, do you not remember that Edwards got his riches as a trial lawyer? Edwards' specialty was suing (for millions of dollars) when babies were born with brain defects. Which he, like other lawyers cashing in on junk science and gullible juries, blamed on the failure of doctors to have had those babies delivered by C-section. Your right though, this writer did report on what was said. To bad the liberal censors didn't get to him first.</p>
