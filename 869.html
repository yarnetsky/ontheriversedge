<div class="post">

<div class="entrytext">

	<p>Dianne Sawyer, one of the TV folks who played Dean&#8217;s &#8220;scream&#8221; speech more than 700 times, has written an <a href "http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/news/wabc_2004vote_012904dean.html">article</a> which essentially said what I wrote a couple weeks ago.</p>

	<p>She wrote in her analysis that Dean was yelling to be heard over a roaring crowd. Because of his special noise-cancelling microphone, TV viewers didn&#8217;t hear the crowd and the cameras did not show the crowd either.</p>

	<p>Journalism isn&#8217;t a science and people make mistakes. I&#8217;ve certainly made mistakes in my time on the beat. But geesh, as an industry this one was bad.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, the mea culpa is way too late. The damage is done. Millions saw the tapes. Thousands might see the clarification.</p>

	<p>The Dean campaign made it&#8217;s own mistakes. During Iowa, he lost his message. Their TV ads were mediocre and he should not have gotten into an attack war with Gephardt. But if the &#8220;scream&#8221; was reported fairly, with the &#8220;roaring&#8221; crowd putting it into context, Dean could have won New Hampshire.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ll admit to being biased. Originally, I liked Kerry. But soon his campaign suffered from Gore syndrome&#8212;over consulted.</p>

	<p>Dean wasn&#8217;t the perfect candidate. He definitely had the &#8220;doctor&#8221; arrogance. But once you understood that, the vibrancy he brought to the campaign was beyond imagine. It was exciting:<br />
<ul><li>Getting $40million from a huge number of small dollar donors. This in a party the Clintons got addicted to soft money to the point is didn&#8217;t know how to raise hard money.</li><br />
<li>Utilizing strategies originally used during the Civil Rights Movement to motivate and mobilize grassroots voters on the ground in New Hampshire.</li><br />
<li>Utilizing the Internet to coordinate huge numbers of supporters and for fundraising.</li><br />
<li>Getting the Democratic Party out of its shellshock to once again be the loyal (and patriotic) opposition.</li><br />
<li>Bringing issues such as realistic health care reform to the forefront.</li><br />
<li>Talking fiscal conservatism in an era when the president is breaking the bank with lopsided tax cuts and multi-billion dollar supplemental budgets.</li><br />
</ul><br />
For all these reasons and more, Dean is owed a huge thanks from Democrats (if not from the whole country). The other Democratic candidates are stealing his lines and the party in general has restored it&#8217;s collective backbone. If the Democrats win in November. They have Dean to thank.</p>

	<p>Want more proof of Dean&#8217;s mark on the current political debate?</p>

	<p>All of the sudden, with admitted encouragement from disgusted conservatives in his own party, the president is talking cutting the deficit in half in five years and is cutting back on many of his own proposals. Similarly, he&#8217;s talking up his own health care initiatives. But that&#8217;s another post.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1217.html" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
