<div class="entrytext">

	<p>I am now officially a graduate student. I have my student ID. I attended my first class. I have my books. I took advantage of my student discount to buy some computer software (Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac $10, etc.). For the past couple of hours I&#8217;ve been sifting through the syllubus. Tomorrow I have a day off and will do a chunk of reading.</p>

	<p><b>First impressions</b>: IUPUI is kind of a barren campus in the middle of winter. Great spanses of lawn with nothing to block the bitter wind. Other things are kind of disappointing. There&#8217;s no university union for the students really and the bookstore is pretty sad. The univeristy is building a campus center for completion in 2007, but with all luck I&#8217;ll be gone by then.</p>

	<p>The university library, which will basically be my Friday home for the next two years, is a different story. The people are friendly and the structure has plenty of windows to let the sun shine in. [<a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/images/univlibrary_1.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.ontheriversedge.com/images/univlibrary_1.html','popup','width=138,height=281,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">View image</a>]</p>

	<p>They have comfortable sitting areas behind the huge signature windows. However, the orientation doesn&#8217;t lend itself to the nicest of views. The sciences building the library faces is probably only 20-years-old, but for some reason the structure is looking tired.</p>

	<p>On the other hand, sitting in the study carrels, the whole southeast wall is glass and the huge windows overlook downtown Indianapolis. You can see the RCADome, the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art, the Indiana State Museum, the State House, Military Park and the skyscrapers around Monument Circle.  Nice view. I could probably site there and soak in the sun&#8230; oh yes, and study.</p>

	<p>The folks in my cataloging class seem pretty cool. We have a slew of<br />
people from all walks of life&#8212;everyone from teachers who realized they didn&#8217;t want to teach to a post-doctoral information science professor wanting to expand her horizons in order to get today&#8217;s &#8220;in&#8221; jobs. Only one other person working in a public library.</p>

	<p>Cataloging is one of those keystone jobs. I never realized how important they were, but I&#8217;m quickly learning, the whole shooting match would be in<br />
disarray without them. I&#8217;ll have to send Joy and Julie (our current and past catalogers) an extra piece of chocolate for Valentines Day.</p>

	<p>My afternoon class, collection development, was cancelled as the prof was at a conference. Actually that helped because it allowed me to buy books and run errands. For example, my VPN account wasn&#8217;t turned on and my webmail isn&#8217;t working. I can send and receive, but I can&#8217;t get replies. When I send a message, it doesn&#8217;t include a &#8220;from&#8221; address. They have not yet figured that one out.</p>

	<p>Darlene came up with me for the first day. She kept me company and helped celebrate my first day. After taking care of the odds and ends we wandered campus and Indy walking and driving around.</p>

	<p><b>iPod craze</b>: We stopped at a Border&#8217;s Books where Darlene bought a new Star Trek and a <a href="http://muttscomics.com/index.asp">Mutts</a> book. We then went to the Apple Store where everyone was drooling over the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/">iPod Shuffle</a>. They haven&#8217;t been able to keep them in stock. They got a few hundred of the chewing gum stick shaped players that morning and sold them out in three hours.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, I bought the iPod I&#8217;ve been saving up for. I obviously wanted to listen to music (Wednesday nights in the children&#8217;s room can get very quiet). But it is a handier tool than I imagined. For starters, the University Library has tons of computers so if I don&#8217;t feel like lugging my laptop along, I can carry all my files along on my iPod and jack it into the firewire port. Secondly, it has all my contacts, calendars and notes.</p>

	<p>Here&#8217;s what I didn&#8217;t expect&#8212;I am able to put hyperlinked archives on the puppy. I downloaded a freeware program called <a href="http://www.flyingmeat.com/voodoopadlite.html">VoodooPad Lite</a>. You type a note and highlight any word. Turn that word into a link and you go to a new page where you write anything about that word. It&#8217;s not unlike a Wiki website. All fine and dandy, but then it all uploaded onto the iPod&#8212;still hyperlinked. I go to the index page and I can click around it like a webpage. That was a revelation.</p>

	<p>By the end of the day we were exhausted. We rented a room and fell asleep. We woke up 12 hours later.</p>

	<p><b>Georgia O&#8217;Keeffe exhibit</b>: After wandering around some more, we finally ended up at the <a href="http://www.eiteljorg.org/ejm/exhibitions.asp?ID=27">Eiteljorg Museum</a> which had just opened a new <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5707736/site/newsweek/">Georgia O&#8217;Keeffe exhibit</a>. It was simply beautiful. It&#8217;ll be open for a couple of months. I plan to return. Another interesting part of the exhibit was quotes from O&#8217;Keeffe. I was also amazed how well spoken-well written she was. Unfortunately, no one there at the time knew where the quotes came from. I need to write the curator and find the source. If it was journals, I suspect they would be very good reading.</p>

	<p>There were several wonderful pieces, but I&#8217;d say my favorites so far were two works she did while on assignment in Hawaii. The Dole company had commissioned her to do some work of pineapples so they could use the work for advertising. She never managed to paint a pineapple, but the two works she did paint are great. Dole later sent a pineapple plant to her home, but the painting was a disappointment.</p>

	<p>That&#8217;s week one down.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/index.php?id=1217" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
