  	<p>I received my first grade of grad school. It was only an exercise worth a 1/10 of my final grade, but it was graded nonetheless. The exercise was in my bibliographic access and control class&#8212;questions about definitions we needed to know and transcribing features from title pages into the proper format for bibliographic records.</p>

	<p>FWIW I got a 9.9 out of 10&#8212;90 more points to go. Back to work, I&#8217;m working on the follow-up exercise now.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>My cataloging class is now delving into the book description details of the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules. The professor this morning went over practically each rule. This was the stuff I was having trouble getting through as I was reading so I thanked her for the review.</p>

	<p>Her response? &#8220;There&#8217;s no way I could tell everyone just to read chapters one and two without reviewing it. It doesn&#8217;t make any sense.&#8221; Thank God I&#8217;m not the only one.</p>

	<p>Actually, once it&#8217;s all explained it does make sense. I&#8217;ve learned enough that I could now create a catalog card using the International Standard Bibliographic Description for a pretty straight forward book. Details relating to the cataloging of books are coming next week.</p>

	<p>Doing MARC (machine readable catalog) records and subject terms could be another story. Our final project is to create full MARC records on 10 books of her chosing. I spent a couple hours photo copying title pages and preliminaries and tech reading the volumes this afternoon. I&#8217;ll dive into them over the next few weeks.</p>

	<p>My collection development professor is giving a talk in Richmond commemorating the final segregated American Libraries Association meeting. After the experience in 1936, the ALA swore never to hold another convention in a segregated city again. Definitely ahead of the curve.</p>

	<p>Either way, because of that she taped her lecture so I&#8217;ll listen to it tomorrow morning. The video will probably be minimal as it is intended to be viewable over a 56K modem.</p>

	<p>When you drive four hours in a day you have plenty of thoughts<br />
-<del><b>Iraq</b>: Old news to anyone paying attention, but I have to agree with Sy Hersh, we&#8217;re not really fighting insurgents. We&#8217;re still fighting Sadam Hussain&#8217;s guys</del>- didn&#8217;t it strike you that we &#8220;won&#8221; Bagdad a little too easy?&#8212;<b>No on Gonzalez</b>: Any attorney who believes the president should be able to break or ignore whatever law he feels is wrong has no business being in the Justice Department. Someone who in essence condones torture has no right being attorney general.&#8212;<b>bad jokes</b>: During the first week of classes I heard someone pronounce SLIS (school of library and information sciences) for the first time. I had always said it S.L.I.S. (like A.L.A. and F.B.I.). She pronounced it &#8220;sliss.&#8221; I said it was awful, but the first thing that popped in my head was a bad joke. &#8220;What do you call a female library sciences student? Slis Miss.&#8221; Today, I saw her again and she told me she told the joke to several of her friends who had a good laugh. Go figure.&#8212;<b>Podcasting</b>: Could podcasting could bring broadcasting to the masses. A friend-fellow librarian, blogged out, has now started podcasting.&#8212;<b>Apple</b>: Pages sounds pretty cool, but v1.0 quirky. iPod shuffles at Wal-Mart? Yuck!&#8212;<b>Sunrises</b>: No wonder farmers want to get out at the crack of dawn. Hoosier sunrises, when the clouds are just right, are downright beautiful. Pinks, oranges and blues bubbling over horizon. I was a challenge to keep my eyes on the road.</p>

	<p>There&#8217;s more, but it&#8217;s time to sleep. We left at 6:45 and got home at 9:15 p.m. Boy what a long day (it could have been shorter, but we got lost in what one nurse at University Hospital calls the &#8220;gerbil tubes&#8221;.)</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>Boy yesterday was a long day. I walked out the door at 6:30 a.m. and walked back in at 7:30 p.m. I didn&#8217;t do much of anything other than attend classes and drive. Let me tell you, my back didn&#8217;t like that one bit. I then slept 11-1/2 hours.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m about as good as new this morning. While, I&#8217;ve been goofing off reading computer stuff this morning, I need to get reading for class. I need to review the book cataloging rules under the AACR2 (Anglo-American Cataloging Rules) for the next class and read a bunch of journal articles for Collection Development.</p>

	<p>My new &#8220;toys&#8221; helped make yesterday seem shorter. As much as I hate the cell phone, being able to talk to Darlene between classes helped immensly. I listened to my iPod during the drive. Music on the way up (Michelle Shock&#8217;s &#8220;Arkansas Traveler&#8221; is a great album) and an audio book on the way home (a collection of Poirot short stories).</p>

	<p>The classes themselves went well. The morning class is a quiet one. Maybe everyone&#8217;s not awake yet. Cataloging is like learning a computer language. There&#8217;s a lot of picky stuff like making sure you have the proper punctuation in the proper spots. It makes me think of CSS. If you have a semi-colon out of place the whole webpage can break down.</p>

	<p>[Darlene just saw a webpoll on CNN.com that asked whether Bush will achieve his second-term goals. It was a simple yes and no question. Darlene says the poll needs a third option. &#8220;How about &#8216;over my dead body&#8217;?&#8221;]</p>

	<p>The collection development class should be a challenge. The professor likes that the SLIS grading system where to get an A you have to do things so creative and beyond expectations that even the professor is surprised. Thus a 4.0 in her class will be very difficult, but hey I&#8217;m a creative sort.</p>

	<p>The class itself is pretty large, 28 students, and at least a third of them are also working in public libraries and studying to become librarians. We already had some good conversations/debate yesterday. It should be fun.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>I&#8217;m slogging through &#8220;Wynar&#8217;s Introduction to Cataloging and Classification&#8221; for my Friday morning class and it&#8217;s slow going.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s not that it&#8217;s really hard to understand. Indeed, it all makes sense. For some reason I&#8217;m just having a hard time getting through it.</p>

	<p>Part of it is learning to focus and strain out the outside world. For example, reading about library technology makes me think about work and everything I have to do there.</p>

	<p>I think the rest of it is simply trying to read a completely different writing style. I&#8217;m used to a journalistic writing style. I read a lot of newspapers and magazines to keep up with current events. I read scientific articles regularly, but even so they are written in a very clear fashion. Everything I&#8217;m read feels as if it needs a good editing for clarity. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll get used to it, until then it is certainly making me feel dumb.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;m keeping my eye on the weather. I fear I&#8217;ll get to Indy and then a blizzard will move in while I&#8217;m in class. Hmmm&#8230; I wonder if they&#8217;ll let me sleep on the tables in the library group study rooms.</p>

<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1041.html" title="Good (slow) start to grad school"> Good (slow) start to grad school</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>I am now officially a graduate student. I have my student ID. I attended my first class. I have my books. I took advantage of my student discount to buy some computer software (Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac $10, etc.). For the past couple of hours I&#8217;ve been sifting through the syllubus. Tomorrow I have a day off and will do a chunk of reading.</p>

	<p><b>First impressions</b>: IUPUI is kind of a barren campus in the middle of winter. Great spanses of lawn with nothing to block the bitter wind. Other things are kind of disappointing. There&#8217;s no university union for the students really and the bookstore is pretty sad. The univeristy is building a campus center for completion in 2007, but with all luck I&#8217;ll be gone by then.</p>

	<p>The university library, which will basically be my Friday home for the next two years, is a different story. The people are friendly and the structure has plenty of windows to let the sun shine in. [<a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedgehttps://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/images/univlibrary_1.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.ontheriversedge.comhttps://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/images/univlibrary_1.html','popup','width=138,height=281,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">View image</a>]</p>

	<p>They have comfortable sitting areas behind the huge signature windows. However, the orientation doesn&#8217;t lend itself to the nicest of views. The sciences building the library faces is probably only 20-years-old, but for some reason the structure is looking tired.</p>

	<p>On the other hand, sitting in the study carrels, the whole southeast wall is glass and the huge windows overlook downtown Indianapolis. You can see the RCADome, the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art, the Indiana State Museum, the State House, Military Park and the skyscrapers around Monument Circle.  Nice view. I could probably site there and soak in the sun&#8230; oh yes, and study.</p>

	<p>The folks in my cataloging class seem pretty cool. We have a slew of<br />
people from all walks of life&#8212;everyone from teachers who realized they didn&#8217;t want to teach to a post-doctoral information science professor wanting to expand her horizons in order to get today&#8217;s &#8220;in&#8221; jobs. Only one other person working in a public library.</p>

	<p>Cataloging is one of those keystone jobs. I never realized how important they were, but I&#8217;m quickly learning, the whole shooting match would be in<br />
disarray without them. I&#8217;ll have to send Joy and Julie (our current and past catalogers) an extra piece of chocolate for Valentines Day.</p>

	<p>My afternoon class, collection development, was cancelled as the prof was at a conference. Actually that helped because it allowed me to buy books and run errands. For example, my VPN account wasn&#8217;t turned on and my webmail isn&#8217;t working. I can send and receive, but I can&#8217;t get replies. When I send a message, it doesn&#8217;t include a &#8220;from&#8221; address. They have not yet figured that one out.</p>

	<p>Darlene came up with me for the first day. She kept me company and helped celebrate my first day. After taking care of the odds and ends we wandered campus and Indy walking and driving around.</p>

	<p><b>iPod craze</b>: We stopped at a Border&#8217;s Books where Darlene bought a new Star Trek and a <a href="http://muttscomics.com/index.asp">Mutts</a> book. We then went to the Apple Store where everyone was drooling over the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/">iPod Shuffle</a>. They haven&#8217;t been able to keep them in stock. They got a few hundred of the chewing gum stick shaped players that morning and sold them out in three hours.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, I bought the iPod I&#8217;ve been saving up for. I obviously wanted to listen to music (Wednesday nights in the children&#8217;s room can get very quiet). But it is a handier tool than I imagined. For starters, the University Library has tons of computers so if I don&#8217;t feel like lugging my laptop along, I can carry all my files along on my iPod and jack it into the firewire port. Secondly, it has all my contacts, calendars and notes.</p>

	<p>Here&#8217;s what I didn&#8217;t expect&#8212;I am able to put hyperlinked archives on the puppy. I downloaded a freeware program called <a href="http://www.flyingmeat.com/voodoopadlite.html">VoodooPad Lite</a>. You type a note and highlight any word. Turn that word into a link and you go to a new page where you write anything about that word. It&#8217;s not unlike a Wiki website. All fine and dandy, but then it all uploaded onto the iPod&#8212;still hyperlinked. I go to the index page and I can click around it like a webpage. That was a revelation.</p>

	<p>By the end of the day we were exhausted. We rented a room and fell asleep. We woke up 12 hours later.</p>

	<p><b>Georgia O&#8217;Keeffe exhibit</b>: After wandering around some more, we finally ended up at the <a href="http://www.eiteljorg.org/ejm/exhibitions.asp?ID=27">Eiteljorg Museum</a> which had just opened a new <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5707736/site/newsweek/">Georgia O&#8217;Keeffe exhibit</a>. It was simply beautiful. It&#8217;ll be open for a couple of months. I plan to return. Another interesting part of the exhibit was quotes from O&#8217;Keeffe. I was also amazed how well spoken-well written she was. Unfortunately, no one there at the time knew where the quotes came from. I need to write the curator and find the source. If it was journals, I suspect they would be very good reading.</p>

	<p>There were several wonderful pieces, but I&#8217;d say my favorites so far were two works she did while on assignment in Hawaii. The Dole company had commissioned her to do some work of pineapples so they could use the work for advertising. She never managed to paint a pineapple, but the two works she did paint are great. Dole later sent a pineapple plant to her home, but the painting was a disappointment.</p>

	<p>That&#8217;s week one down.</p>
