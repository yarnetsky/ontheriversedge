	<p><b>Planting the flag</b>: The pile of snow now in front of our shop is maybe five feet tall. We figured no one would see our sandwich sign that we were open today so Darlene climbed the snow mountain and planted our open flag on top. I&#8217;ll post a photo later.</p>

	<p><b>NekoBus unburied</b>: It took us more than an hour, but we managed to shovel our van out last night. We really have no desire to go anywhere, but I knew we wouldn&#8217;t want to tackle it with temps in the single digits if we had an emergency. It was parked close to the corner, but the city dozer (pictured in previous post) was nicer to us and didn&#8217;t dump any snow on us.</p>

	<p><b>Not so lucky on Main</b>: One of our friends is a shopkeep that lives above her store on Main Street. Yesterday, she unburied her car so she could get to work today. Overnight the snow plow buried her in again&#8212;five feet deep.</p>

	<p>According to Darlene, she was mad as a hornet this morning. &#8220;I&#8217;m sending a bill to the governor. There were only two cars on the block, they could have put the snow behind me.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Knowing her luck the state, which plows Main Street, would probably say something like &#8220;a snow emergency means no cars on the street, parking included.&#8221; It doubt it wouldn&#8217;t mean anything to them that her nearest off street parking was two blocks away in a snow bound parking lot she couldn&#8217;t get into.</p>

	<p><b>No snowmen</b>: The snow is very heavy and a couple of my muscles were rather sore after shoveling. As heavy as it was, the stuff still too powdery. Darlene and I wanted to make a snowman infront of our shop, but it wouldn&#8217;t ball up. Mind you the creation would have been buried by the plow. Would that have been considered murder?</p>

	<p><b>Roundabout</b>: We heard from a customer that I-75 in Ohio is really slow going. The Ohio Dept. of Transportation website said much of it is snow covered and icy. Mind you, there are several variations of snow covered and icy. Is it, snowy but drivable or is it you&#8217;re crazy to try it snowy and ice covered?</p>

 Louisville didn&#8217;t get as much snow as we did, but they got a lot more ice and the roads are a mess.

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/index.php?id=1217" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
