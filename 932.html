<div class="post">

<div class="entrytext">

	<p>Every day, I look through <a href="http://www.macsurfer.com">MacSurfer</a> and gather all the news that&#8217;s fit to Mac. I&#8217;d have bought Apple stock at $8 a share if I had the money (boy do I wish). I own an iBook laptop and enjoys surfing in bed by Wi-Fi. Thus I might as well face it that I&#8217;m an <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> geek.</p>

	<p>Being an Apple geek is easy. Steve Jobs comes out with fun products that work and you get to make fun of Microsoft too. (Though I&#8217;ll give Bill Gates tons of credit for giving computers to <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Libraries/">libraries</a>).</p>

	<p>No one harasses me for being an Apple geek. Indeed, people are sending people my way at the library to answer Mac questions. Being a geek can be fun.</p>

	<p>Yet, as if it wasn&#8217;t obvious, I&#8217;m also among the 28 percent of Americans who are &#8220;closely following the election.&#8221; The extent to which would definitely classifies me as a political geek. For example, I don&#8217;t follow the national polls. I follow the state polls&#8212;the ones that really matter. Check out <a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com">electoral-vote.com</a>.</p>

	<p>But being a political geek in a small town is hard sometimes.</p>

	<p>On one hand, I&#8217;d love to go campaigning door-to-door for candidates who&#8217;ll make a difference. I did this once for a city council candidate in Toledo. You really feel like you make connections even if you lose (my candidate won state rep. the following year).</p>

	<p>On the other hand, I don&#8217;t want my politics to interfer with my work or my wife&#8217;s pottery either.</p>

	<p>I want everyone to feel comfortable they can come to me for help finding information. On the flip side, I don&#8217;t want to be harassed in the library for my views either.</p>

	<p>Darlene and I already had a guy from Pennsylvania come into our pottery studio and literally bait us into a political argument.</p>

	<p>By speaking out in public (or even putting a Kerry sign in my bedroom window), I fear I&#8217;d get more of the same or that my job would be compromised. Sometimes I feel even writing in this blog may cost me somehow in the future.</p>

	<p>Yet, sometimes I feel like the call to speak out (and not just blog) overwhelming.</p>

	<p>Let me give an example. There&#8217;s an article in this week&#8217;s <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5411741/site/newsweek">Newsweek</a> about how the Department of Homeland Security is seriously looking at getting the power from Congress to postpone the elections in case of a terrorist attack.</p>

	<p>On the face of it, I find this scary. For the past year, my father-in-law kept saying Bush was going to try cancelling the election. But until he sent me a copy of the article, I just didn&#8217;t think anyone could think of altering such an integral part of our democracy. Now I&#8217;m not so sure. This <b>is</b> the same administration that&#8217;s pushing the Pakistani government to <a href="http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&#38;sid=aiQyYlkml67U&#38;refer=us">capture or kill top Al-Queda</a> operatives during the first three days of the Democratic National Convention.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ll withhold judgement until I see the legislation, but I swear if I feel Bush is trying to corrupt the system, I&#8217;ll be protesting loud and long. At that point I won&#8217;t care about my reputation.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1217.html" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
