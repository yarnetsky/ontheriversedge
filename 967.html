	<p>When my father died, he was a police officer at Miami University. For the most part it was a peaceful job, but I do remember one of his cohorts being faced with a drug-crazed college student weilding a switch-blade. It could have been a lot worse.</p>

	<p>With the ban on semi-automatic weapons set to expire on Monday, it is easy to imagine worse.</p>

	<p>Obviously, my father owned guns and regularly practiced their use. A few times he had taken me to the shooting range. I&#8217;ve shot a few rounds, but it didn&#8217;t really interest me.</p>

	<p>My dad said the key to guns is respect and safety. You respect their power, you keep them locked up when not in use. With that in mind, I don&#8217;t have a problem with gun ownership. If we ever get our building to a state of non-chaos, I could finally display an antique flintlock my father gave me.</p>

	<p>But even with the respect for gun ownership, I still have no idea what use a semi-automatic weapon would be to anyone.</p>

	<p>What do AK-47s have to do with hunting?<br />
Why do gun makers advertise their arms as <a href="http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/shooting/0424guns9.shtml">&#8220;fingerprint proof&#8221;</a>?</p>

	<p>I think Kerry said it aptly <a title="The New York Times > Kerry Says Bush Assault Weapons Stance Aids Terrorists&#8221; href=&#8221;http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/10/politics/campaign/10CND-CAMP.html?hp&#8221;> today</a>...<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Four years ago,&#8221; Mr. Kerry said in St. Louis, &#8220;George Bush said he&#8217;d stand with and protect America&#8217;s police officers by extending the assault-weapons ban, which keeps the most dangerous assault weapons off our streets, the same weapons that America&#8217;s police officers want off our streets, not just to fight ordinary crime but to take on terrorists.</p>

	<p>&#8220;In fact,&#8221; the Democratic presidential candidate went on, &#8220;an Al Qaeda training manual recovered in Afghanistan included a chapter urging terrorists to get assault weapons in the United States. Why is George Bush making the job of the terrorists easier and making the job for America&#8217;s police officers harder?&#8221;</blockquote></p>

	<p>Yes, a terrorist can use of about anything as a weapon&#8212;Timothy McVeigh proved that. Yet why should we make access to these weapons easy? Who benefits? I just don&#8217;t get it.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1217.html" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
