	<p>My cataloging class is now delving into the book description details of the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules. The professor this morning went over practically each rule. This was the stuff I was having trouble getting through as I was reading so I thanked her for the review.</p>

	<p>Her response? &#8220;There&#8217;s no way I could tell everyone just to read chapters one and two without reviewing it. It doesn&#8217;t make any sense.&#8221; Thank God I&#8217;m not the only one.</p>

	<p>Actually, once it&#8217;s all explained it does make sense. I&#8217;ve learned enough that I could now create a catalog card using the International Standard Bibliographic Description for a pretty straight forward book. Details relating to the cataloging of books are coming next week.</p>

	<p>Doing MARC (machine readable catalog) records and subject terms could be another story. Our final project is to create full MARC records on 10 books of her chosing. I spent a couple hours photo copying title pages and preliminaries and tech reading the volumes this afternoon. I&#8217;ll dive into them over the next few weeks.</p>

	<p>My collection development professor is giving a talk in Richmond commemorating the final segregated American Libraries Association meeting. After the experience in 1936, the ALA swore never to hold another convention in a segregated city again. Definitely ahead of the curve.</p>

	<p>Either way, because of that she taped her lecture so I&#8217;ll listen to it tomorrow morning. The video will probably be minimal as it is intended to be viewable over a 56K modem.</p>

	<p>When you drive four hours in a day you have plenty of thoughts<br />
-<del><b>Iraq</b>: Old news to anyone paying attention, but I have to agree with Sy Hersh, we&#8217;re not really fighting insurgents. We&#8217;re still fighting Sadam Hussain&#8217;s guys</del>- didn&#8217;t it strike you that we &#8220;won&#8221; Bagdad a little too easy?&#8212;<b>No on Gonzalez</b>: Any attorney who believes the president should be able to break or ignore whatever law he feels is wrong has no business being in the Justice Department. Someone who in essence condones torture has no right being attorney general.&#8212;<b>bad jokes</b>: During the first week of classes I heard someone pronounce SLIS (school of library and information sciences) for the first time. I had always said it S.L.I.S. (like A.L.A. and F.B.I.). She pronounced it &#8220;sliss.&#8221; I said it was awful, but the first thing that popped in my head was a bad joke. &#8220;What do you call a female library sciences student? Slis Miss.&#8221; Today, I saw her again and she told me she told the joke to several of her friends who had a good laugh. Go figure.&#8212;<b>Podcasting</b>: Could podcasting could bring broadcasting to the masses. A friend-fellow librarian, blogged out, has now started podcasting.&#8212;<b>Apple</b>: Pages sounds pretty cool, but v1.0 quirky. iPod shuffles at Wal-Mart? Yuck!&#8212;<b>Sunrises</b>: No wonder farmers want to get out at the crack of dawn. Hoosier sunrises, when the clouds are just right, are downright beautiful. Pinks, oranges and blues bubbling over horizon. I was a challenge to keep my eyes on the road.</p>

	<p>There&#8217;s more, but it&#8217;s time to sleep. We left at 6:45 and got home at 9:15 p.m. Boy what a long day (it could have been shorter, but we got lost in what one nurse at University Hospital calls the &#8220;gerbil tubes&#8221;.)</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" href="http://www.ontheriversedge.com/index.php?id=1217" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
