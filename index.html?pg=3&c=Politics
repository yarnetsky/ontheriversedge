  	<p>It appears the impending indictments against Rove and Libby are just  the tip of the iceberg. </p>

	<p>Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald has just <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/osc/">created a new website</a>, <a href="http://www.thewashingtonnote.com/archives/001033.html">expanded his office space</a> and <a href="http://turcopolier.typepad.com/sic_semper_tyrannis/2005/10/aides_to_be_ind.html">requested a new grand jury</a>.</p>

	<p>Valarie Plame was clearly outed for a reason. Joe Wilson was smeared for a reason. It all ties together with why we are in Iraq and specifically how we got there. </p>

	<p>It certainly seems as if this is the direction Fitzgerald is heading. I must admit, I&#8217;m very interested in seeing what the answers are. For once I just want the truth.</p>

  	<p>It seems like once every other week or so I get into arguments over Bush. </p>

	<p>This time I stepped into it simply not knowing the other guy was a big Bush fan. He said something akin to how the Hurricane Katrina relief effort was botched. I responded that we need to appoint professionals to positions like FEMA instead of Bush cronies with no experience. He then said I was being spun by the media and that it was Gov. Blanco who screwed up the relief effort.</p>

	<p>I tried to back out of it saying &#8220;let&#8217;s just appoint an independent panel to see where the errors occurred and correct them no matter who screwed up.&#8221; He argued &#8220;independent&#8221; doesn&#8217;t exist. Whatever. <br />
There&#8217;s no sense arguing with someone like that. </p>

	<p>Either way, this time it&#8217;s nice to see the conservatives fuming at Bush. With the nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court, it is the conservatives who suddenly feel sold out by Bush appointing a crony. </p>

	<p>I laughed when I read there are even rumblings from a few conservative senators about filibustering the choice. Wait, I thought the president deserved an up or down vote on his nominees.</p>

	<p>Who knows, maybe they&#8217;ll finally start to see the truth about the guy. He&#8217;s sold us all out.</p>

	<p>If you want a selective overview of what the conservative side has been saying, here&#8217;s a diary from <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/10/4/123124/331">Daily Kos.com</a></p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p><strong>note</strong>: OK, I&#8217;m back. I&#8217;ve been moving from my summer schedule to my school year schedule (at work, school, etc.) and as a result haven&#8217;t had a day off for a couple weeks. But fear not, put on your reading glazes and have a glass of <a href="http://www.thomasfamilywinery.us">wine</a> (whine?)... it&#8217;s blogging time&#8230;</p>

	<p>There is no doubt that the gulf coast needs relief as whole communities have been flooded or wiped off the maps by the Hurricane Katrina. The urge is righteous, but the face is wrong.</p>

	<p>The face in question is Karl Rove. I find it interesting that George W. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/15/politics/15bush.html">just put his head political crony in charge of reconstruction</a>.<br />
How can Rove, the person charged with keeping our nation divided and floating political blame, understand how to rebuild New Orleans and the Gulf Coast? Then again, Bush <em>was</em> the person who put a diploma-mill horse attorney with no emergency managment experience in charge of the Federal Emergency Management Agency so I guess it makes sense.</p>

	<p>Yet, I also realize this is the administration that literally lost $8 billion (with a capital B) in Iraq with absolutely no clue as to where it went. I guess a tiger can&#8217;t change its stripes.</p>

	<p>Other signs of trouble:</p>

	<p>*The recent approved $50B+ relief bill eliminated a lot of the oversight on contracts and credit card charging. </p>
	<p>*The Republicans want a partisan commission to <del>look into</del> cover up the tragedy.</p>
	<p>*Bush announced they are planning to rebuild the gulf coast without so much as one bit of sacrifice in our budget. </p>

	<p>Hmmm&#8230; how can we pay for a war, huge tax cuts for Bush cronies, stupid budget priorities and the gulf rebuilding without a sacrifice somewhere in the system? This combination is going to kill our economy. </p>

	<p>Oddly, it&#8217;s kind of nice to see a few conservatives finally <br />
foam at the mouth. A couple of Republican senators and congressmen (ie Sen. Tom Coburn R-OK) want dollar for dollar budget cuts in exchange for rebuilding the gulf coast.</p>

	<p>The bottom line is that I smell the coming of the biggest fiscal fiasco/crisis/debacle/boondogle/ in our nation&#8217;s history. If we don&#8217;t have independent auditors on this puppy we&#8217;re going to lose our shirts.</p>

	<p>This is not a question of should we help. A few conservatives talk as if  we should not help rebuild the coast. We should&#8212;though with strict construction guidelines to avoid future loses. </p>

	<p>Rather, this is a question of how do we keep this administration honest when it is known they have no fiscal (or any other) accountability because we need to make sure this money helps rebuild communities&#8212;not illegally pad the profits of Halliburton and related corporate ilk.</p>

  	<p>OK, so I won&#8217;t shut up.</p>

	<p>I just found out the military was waiting to help, but that <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/9/5/15109/84491">federal law said they couldn&#8217;t until the president said yes</a>. He didn&#8217;t. He was on vacation. On the bullshit meter, this rates a 10.</p>

	<p>Then, just to point out that ample warning was given to everyone who would listen that a killer hurricane was coming, a meteorologist outlines just a few of the <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/9/6/3840/39445">warnings given by the National Weather Service</a>.</p>

	<p>The bottom line is that Bush should have authorized military help <strong><em>before</em></strong> it hit. The military was ready, he was not. If Bush was a general he would have been dismissed and be facing a court martial no ands, ifs or buts.</p>

  	<p>Let me count the ways&#8230;</p>

	<li><a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/84aa35cc-1da8-11da-b40b-00000e2511c8.html">FEMA won&#8217;t accept Amtrak&#8217;s help in evacuations</a>.</li>

	</ol>

	<p>Unfortunately, this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

	<p>Again, the Department of Homeland Security butchered the agency traditionally used for natural disaster relief and didn&#8217;t put anything in its place. Then Bush hired an attorney with no disaster management experience to run the shop. Incompetents.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s just that so many, many good people have been chomping at the bit to help and haven&#8217;t been allowed to. At least they brought in an Army general that seems to be getting things going. I&#8217;ll give them credit for finally doing something right. </p>

	<p>I think relief is starting to happen (I hope). Thus I will shut up and let them do their work in peace. However, if the Bush administration starts to play the blame game or if they stonewall the needed investigation, then you better bet heads will roll.</p>

<strong>Note</strong>: I stole the list of links from DavidNYC who posted the list at <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/9/5/16455/30830">Daily Kos</a>. I thank him for putting links to my frustrations. I&#8217;ll add more if I get the time.

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>Over the last few days I have been beyond myself in anger. I have never seen this absolute level of incompetence and negligence from our government. The days we let people suffer unimaginable pain and death.</p>

	<p>Having seen this I now have the horrible knowledge that our government is broken. Knowing that our country is a sitting duck with our wings clipped. This is the government we get for cutting taxes and giving away billions upon billions to already stinking rich corporatiions while cutting government to pay for a war of choice. We get a government that can&#8217;t address basic functions of government.</p>

	<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency once had been a pretty efficient agent for dealing with disasters. They were able to martial resources and get them on the ground. But after 9-11 the agency was butchered and merged into the Department of Homeland Security. This was the first test of the system that was supposed to protect our security and it failed so miserably that if I were a teacher I couldn&#8217;t even give them an F because that might mean they might got 50 percent of things right. </p>

	<p>I&#8217;d give them a 0 because not only did they refuse to respond, they repeatedly turned away help. They refused to let the Red Cross into New Orleans, they refused help from experienced boaters in the search efforts, they refused water-bombers from the U.S. Forest Service to quell the fires in New Orleans, they have refused skilled help from other countries and the list goes on. It&#8217;s like a like a rural fire company trying to single handedly deal with a massive forest fire and turning away help.</p>

	<p>Even worse is they knew this was coming. </p>

	<p>Everyone and their brother knew the levees would be overwhelmed in this situation. It was in the media, it was discussed repeatedly by government and by the meteological community. Hell, these levees were only designed to withstand a cat 3 hurricane! They knew at least two days in advance that a category five hurricane was coming to New Orleans (we lucked out that it was a four.)</p>

	<p>New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson &#8220;got it.&#8221; He offered his National Guard before the hurricane hit and Gov. Blanco accepted immediately because she knew 40 percent of her guard was in Iraq. But why were they not on the ground? Washington didn&#8217;t sign the orders until FOUR DAYS after the hurricane hit!</p>

	<p>This <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/03/AR2005090301653.html">list goes on and on and on</a>. Just pay attention. Even Fox has outlined the problems here. Read <a href="http://www.dailykos.com">Daily Kos</a>, read anything and you&#8217;ll see the truth.</p>

	<p>This incompetance is absolutely criminal and it now seems that only the grace of the Good Lord will help us from here on out. Our government is broken and someone will pay!</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  <strong>note</strong>: a post from my wife. I need to get her a blog.

	<p>From the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4204754.stm">mouth of our president:</a></p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees. They did appreciate a serious storm but these levees got breached and as a result much of New Orleans is flooded and now we&#8217;re having to deal with it and will.&#8221;</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>He hasn&#8217;t a clue, does he???  His administration was responsible for cutting funds that were being used to continue upgrading those levees!  It was all over the news last week that a hurricane hitting New Orleans could ruin the levees!  Jer and I read a big expose about what would happen in New Orleans if a major hurricane hit, that the (New Orleans) Times-Picayune published over a year ago!  </p>

	<p>And he didn&#8217;t cut his vacation short until Tuesday to deal with the situation, though he was out campaigning for his social security program on Monday.  Why isn&#8217;t the full force of our military down there?  We have a city of a half a million covered in floodwaters with more than 30,000 trapped!  Hello????  </p>

	<p>And he is fussing over looting.  If I were poor with no transportation, no food, no water, and trapped in a flooded city for 3 days already, I might be a little angry as well!  And certainly would break into places for food and water and whatever else needed.  As for the other looting, I think we are seeing a lot of angry people that believe they have been abandoned and who can blame them?  I would be angry enough to destroy things too if I were in that position! </p>

	<p>Yes some people stayed out of pure stubborness or disbelief.  However, many of the ones who stayed were poor.  Many had no vehicles, and those who did often turned back when they couldn&#8217;t find gas stations that had fuel!  Many were tourists whose flights had been cancelled. And the first comments about using the superdome said that they were taking elderly and ill people first.  Yes buses did take people to the superdome, but how many buses?  And the people were told to bring their own food ect.  Now imagine a family with no vehicle, walking with their children and supplies through the rain to catch a bus to a place that they are not even sure they are going to be admitted.  No wonder some of them stayed put!  </p>

	<p>Okay, that&#8217;s my rant.  I don&#8217;t blame everything on Bush, but his lack of knowledge of the situation is appalling. We need better leadership than this.</p>

	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>
