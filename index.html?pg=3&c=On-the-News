<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1184.html" title="No smoking in Madison?"> No smoking in Madison?</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>The city council of our fair city is considering a smoking ban in public places and the debate has been lively and interesting. Here&#8217;s the latest article on <a href="http://madisoncourier.com/main.asp?Search=1&#38;ArticleID=28133&#38;SectionID=4&#38;SubSectionID=&#38;S=1">the debate from the Madison Courier</a> </p>
	<p>I generally favor the ordinance. I&#8217;d love to never encounter smoking as I have asthma and my wife has severe smoke allergies. Nonetheless, many of those opposed argue against the ordinance over &#8220;property rights.&#8221; While bars are exempt in the proposed ordinance, a couple restaurants are arguing they should not be forced to lose their smoking patrons. </p>
	<p>Maybe there&#8217;s a compromise. </p>
	<p>My thoughts echo those of a former Madison teacher. Fellow Madison blogger JT Evans recently quoted a the teacher as stating: <a href="http://jte39madjeffin.blogspot.com/2006/01/keep-fda-off-farm.html">My freedom to swing my fist ends where the other person&#8217;s nose begins</a> </p>
	<p>The whole post is pretty good and captures our small town &#8220;politeness&#8221; on the matter, but I think the quote is the essence of the matter for me&#8230;</p>
	<p>If I have a choice of going into an establishment, I don&#8217;t care what they do. Swing your fist all you want. I don&#8217;t have to go into a given restaurant, there are others within a block.</p>
	<p>On the other hand, if I DON&#8217;T have a choice, the business should be smoke free. This would include places like drug stores, laundrymats, gas stations, banks, groceries&#8212;the general neccesities of life.</p>
	<p>The gas station across the street is almost always full of smoke. I hate going in there, but it&#8217;s so darn convenient that I go anyway and wash my face when I get home. Our grocery down the street used to allowed smoking until a few of us complained a few years ago. Our downtown laundrymat allows smoking and before we had a washer we&#8217;d have to rush our clothes out as fast as we could. </p>
	<p>The bottom line is being forced to face smoke when dealing with a necessary business is not freedom and it certainly hinders the pursuit of happiness.</p>
	<p>I understand this is the northern limit of the tobacco belt and that smoking has long been considered patriotic, but please don&#8217;t punch my nose in the process.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>Did you know that you are no longer allowed to anonymously write <a href="http://news.com.com/Create+an+e-annoyance%2C+go+to+jail/2010-1028_3-6022491.html">annoying blogs or emails</a>?</p>
 <blockquote>Annoying someone via the Internet is now a federal crime.
	<p>It&#8217;s no joke. Last Thursday, President Bush signed into law a prohibition on posting annoying Web messages or sending annoying e-mail messages without disclosing your true identity.</p>
	<p>In other words, it&#8217;s OK to flame someone on a mailing list or in a blog as long as you do it under your real name. Thank Congress for small favors, I guess.</p>
	<p>This ridiculous prohibition, which would likely imperil much of Usenet, is buried in the so-called Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act. Criminal penalties include stiff fines and two years in prison.</blockquote></p>
	<p>Let&#8217;s see, according to Wikipedia, &#8220;annoyance is an unpleasant mental state that is characterized by such effects as irritation and distraction from one&#8217;s conscious thinking. It can lead to emotions such as frustration and anger.&#8221; </p>
	<p>Heck, there have been anonymous posters on a local forum that have &#8220;annoyed&#8221; the heck out of me. Can I send the Justice Department after them? </p>
	<p>To be fair, I annoyed them with my votes on our local historic district architecture review board so maybe we&#8217;re even. Nonetheless, this is a pretty dangerous and could easily be used to squelch protected political speech. </p>
	<p>It&#8217;s tempting to put the law to test. A friend who emailed me this article said they were thinking of starting a mass movement to send annoying emails to King George. That would be very satisfying, but for that purpose I&#8217;d like to put my name on it in 72pt type&#8212;John Hancock had the right idea there.</p>

  	<p>A few days ago I wrote Senator Evan Bayh asking him to vote against the Patriot Act closure move and filibuster until they got a good bill.</p>

	<p>This was before I learned the FBI had been using National Security Letters as if it was candy. They used 30,000 some letters to snag personal information. </p>

	<p>This was before I heard this week that Bush himself authorized domestic wiretaps without a warrent.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m glad I wrote the letter because our country is looking more and more like Orwell&#8217;s vision.</p>

  <p><strong>updated...</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051117/NEWS01/511170493">From an article in today Indianapolis Star</a><p>

<blockquote>
<p>A LOOK AT POVERTY AND LOW-INCOME LEVELS<br />
The federal government makes distinctions between poverty and low-income levels.</p>

<p>POVERTY LEVEL<br />
A family in poverty -- earning no more than $19,157 a year before taxes for a two-parent family of four -- would be eligible for assistance programs such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps and free school lunches.</p>

<p>ABOVE POVERTY LEVEL<br />
A family of the same size can earn up to $5,999 more a year -- $25,156 a year before taxes -- before losing eligibility for temporary aid.</p>

<p>NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FOOD STAMPS<br />
A low-income family of the same size, making an additional $3,869 a year -- $29,025 a year before taxes -- would lose eligibility for food stamps and free lunches, as well as the temporary assistance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, so far so good. $29,025 sounds like a lot of money. Heck, I have yet to make that much money per year in my lifetime (though I may after I graduate with my MLS). Mind you, I don't have two children either. </p>

<p>But here's the kicker...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A study based on the cost of living in Indiana says the same family of four needs $42,850 to meets basic budget needs. Based on that, 41 percent of Indiana children -- 735,000 kids -- live in families not earning enough to meet basic needs.</p>

<p>Sources: Indiana Youth Institute, Indiana Institute for Working Families.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Says something to the nation we live in doesn't it? This is exactly why I am glad the Democrats and 22 moderate GOP members <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20051117/ap_on_go_co/congress_spending;_ylt=AntSqkIDjXwqV9rqF6F63Yys0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA3OXIzMDMzBHNlYwM3MDM-">Democrats managed to block</a> (for now) massive cuts to programs for low-income families.</p>

<p><strong>update</strong>: "For now" was the truth, the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/18/congress.budgetcuts.ap/">GOoPers twisted arms again</a> and the cuts were passed on the backs of the poor, students and farmers. Glad has obviously turned to mad.</p>

<p>"But sir, we have to punish the poor for being poor, they did it to themselves," the U.S. Rep said. "What do you expect us to do? Not pass another $70 billion tax cut for the rich? Not eliminate the Estate Tax that only effects the richest of the rich?"</p>

<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1171.html" title="Did we use chemical weapons in Iraq?"> Did we use chemical weapons in Iraq?</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p><strong>Updated</strong></p>

	<p>The Italian network RAI last night ran a documentary on the attack of Fallujah. RAI claims American troops used White Phosphorus as a mass killing agent during the attack.</p>

	<p>If true, this is a war crime. Under an international treaty signed by the United States in 1997, use of WP against civilians is illegal. It&#8217;s a chemical weapon.</p>

	<p>Here&#8217;s an article (translated by Babelfish so it&#8217;s rough) from Italy&#8217;s newspaper <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/trurl_pagecontent?lp=it_en&#38;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.repubblica.it%2F2005%2Fk%2Fsezioni%2Festeri%2Firaq71%2Frainews%2Frainews.html">Repubblica about the WP attacks in Fallujah</a></p>

	<p>The first question is whether this is true. Apparently, the documentary included interviews of former US military personnel as well as film and photographic &#8220;evidence&#8221;.</p>

	<p>The second question is if we indeed used WP, did we do so legally. The fine line is that troops can apparently use WP to illuminate enemy positions. If we used it in this manner, were there any actions taken to avoid civilian harm? The documentary aims to show the chemical was used indiscriminately.</p>

	<p>We complained that Sadam Hussain using chemical weapons. If this accusation turns out to be true that we used chemical weapons as well, we might as well turn in our badge as &#8220;policeman of the world.&#8221; If this is true our credibility in the world will be zero. </p>

	<p>At that point our only chance at credibility would be to impeach the president and the entire administration.</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.chris-floyd.com/fallujah/">Here&#8217;s a link to the video</a></p>

	<p>I read of this story over at <a href="http://www.dailykos.com">Dailykos.com</a> and I am sure there will be further followups. Here are the initial links.</p>

  	<p>It appears the impending indictments against Rove and Libby are just  the tip of the iceberg. </p>

	<p>Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald has just <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/osc/">created a new website</a>, <a href="http://www.thewashingtonnote.com/archives/001033.html">expanded his office space</a> and <a href="http://turcopolier.typepad.com/sic_semper_tyrannis/2005/10/aides_to_be_ind.html">requested a new grand jury</a>.</p>

	<p>Valarie Plame was clearly outed for a reason. Joe Wilson was smeared for a reason. It all ties together with why we are in Iraq and specifically how we got there. </p>

	<p>It certainly seems as if this is the direction Fitzgerald is heading. I must admit, I&#8217;m very interested in seeing what the answers are. For once I just want the truth.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>One hundred years ago (15 October 1905 to be precise)...</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8220;Little Nemo had just fallen asleep when an Oomp appeared, who said, &#8216;You are requested to appear before his majesty, Morpheus of Slumberland.&#8217; &#8221; The Oomp then presents Nemo with Somnus, a gentle horse to ride into Slumberland.&#8221;</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>That&#8217;s the opening panel of Windsor McCay&#8217;s &#8220;Little Nemo in Slumberland,&#8221; THE best comic strip of the early 20th century and one of the top five in comic history. </p>

	<p>Until you see it you don&#8217;t believe it. The art and the color are just second to none. Unfortunately, examples of McCay&#8217;s work has become harder to find and it&#8217;s hard to appreciate this guy&#8217;s genius without examples.</p>

	<p>That said I was estatic when Darlene sent me an article from yesterday&#8217;s New York Times that Peter Maresca had, against all logic, decided to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/17/books/17nemo.html">reproduce 110 original Little Nemo strips</a>.</p>

	<p>Why is this against logic? Well first, many of the existing strips are in poor shape and the restoration effort was immense. Secondly he decided to reproduce the <em>entire</em> experience of reading a Little Nemo strip. </p>

	<p>Today we&#8217;re used to comic strips that are maybe four square inches. In the early days of comics, however, they occupied an entire page of the Sunday paper measuring more than a foot wide and nearly two feet in height. So this book is a monster 16-inches by 21-inches and it is printed on newsprint with the same texture of newsprint used in 1905. This is literally the first time in 100 years these strips have been published in their <a href="http://sundaypressbooks.com/fullsizesun-new/index.html">original size</a>.</p>

	<p>Check out the book website at <a href="http://www.sundaypressbooks.com">Sunday Press Books</a>. Here are some <a href="http://sundaypressbooks.com/bookpage.htm">sample pages</a> from the book.</p>

	<p>Just seeing the samples, this book is a grand slam home run. </p>

	<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Oh Wow! Oh Wow! Oh Wow! I just opened a letter from my mom with the NY Times article with a note that she was getting me the book for my birthday next year! whoooooohoooooo!!!!</p>

	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>
