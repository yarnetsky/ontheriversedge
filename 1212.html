	<p>This is the first summer we&#8217;re observing Daylight Saving Time here in the Hoosier state and having not experienced the phenomena for more than a dozen years I must say that it is rather strange to have it light out after 9 p.m. However, I really like the extra hour of darkness in the morning and it postpones the heat of the day by an hour.</p>
	<p>Snippets from a hectic life here on the river&#8217;s edge&#8230;</p>
	<p>I just finished my first summer class last week and another class is starting up on July 1. In two dozen weeks I will be done.</p>
	<p>Our good friends Ellen and Hugh had a very good looking child yesterday&#8212;William Boyd at approx. 20&#8221; and 7.65lbs. Yes they&#8217;re weighing in decimals these days. This is the first time I saw a newborn when age was being counted in hours and not days or months. Meanwhille we&#8217;ve been watching William&#8217;s older sister on and off for the last few days as mom is in the hospital. Big sister is a good egg.</p>
	<p>Darlene has finally had a migraine-free day after what seems like a million day. We hope this functioning brain is a new trend.</p>
	<p>I added a new mascot to my repertoire. So far I&#8217;ve been Cat in the Hat, Froggy and now Curious George. Of course the minute I came into the library auditorium a kid starts crying. I admit that a 6-foot-4 monkey can be intimitating (the costume adds a few inches to my 6-foot frame). A parent told me afterward that the mom was telling the kid as she was dragging him from the room&#8230;&#8221;It&#8217;s just some guy in a costume, what are you so upset about.&#8221; Of course the library staff is now teasing me that I terrified a kid. sheesh&#8230;</p>
	<p>I&#8217;m going to have to shave off part of my beard for the first timie in more than a dozen years as I have to have a mole taken off my jaw. So now I&#8217;ll have to look at my chubby cheeks even more (they talk about the Freshman 15 I&#8217;ve gain the grad school 15)... oh well.</p>
	<p>Lobbying government can indeed work. Darlene and I along with a few others successfully lobbied city parks board to keep Crystal Beach Pool open in the evenings and I helped get a change in our county&#8217;s health policy. To bad I can&#8217;t get our reps and senators to listen to us.</p>
	<p>Later gaters&#8230;</p>

<p>Thanks for the newsy post.  Tell Ellen and Hugh that William Boyd was the fabulous “Hopalong Cassidy” of the ancient black and white oaters.  Glad to hear Darlene got a respite from migraine.  I like DST because at last we are in sync with virtually all of the towns and counties surrounding us.  And way to go on your lobbying efforts.  Please call on me to help and I’ll do what I can.</p><br />

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1217.html" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
