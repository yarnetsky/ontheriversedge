<div class="post">

<div class="entrytext">

	<p>This morning I starred at the ring of fire and leaped through to Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve been playing with it on and off all a day and it is one sweet cat. I get an educational discount so Tiger only ran me $70, but I&#8217;m thinking I&#8217;d be happy if I did have to pay $130. Here&#8217;s my experience so far&#8230;</p>

	<p><b>Installation</b>: Installation was mostly painless though I did decent amount of preparation to avoid trouble. Here&#8217;s what I did&#8230;</p>

	<p>I backed up my user folders, my applications and libraries. At that point I ran out of space on my iPod. I used Onyx to repair permissions, cleared cache and ran the maintenance scripts. Then I ran DiskWarrior and repaired the directories. I double checked whether I needed any new firmware.</p>

	<p>Then I bit the bullet and installed Tiger. I was mildly surprised that the default setup simply upgrades the system. You have to chose &#8220;options&#8221; to choose either an &#8220;archive and install&#8221; or &#8220;erase and install.&#8221; I chose &#8220;archive and install&#8221; as it gave me a clean new system folder while still porting over my old settings. The whole process from there was maybe 30 minutes tops.</p>

	<p>A few things didn&#8217;t work off the bat. Norton&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t work and Virtual PC needs an minor upgrade. If you go to the <a href="http://www.macintouch.com/tigerreview/">Macintouch</a> website, you&#8217;ll find a full review including a software compatibility chart. It reported that there were a few security problems and asked if I wanted to fix them. I did, but I honestly don&#8217;t know what it meant. Even so, the shakeout time was minimal.</p>

	<p><b>It&#8217;s a speedy cat</b>: Once Spotlight, Tiger&#8217;s new system searching software, finished indexed my hard drive the speed differences became evident. It sounds odd, but everything simply does what it should when it should. There&#8217;s no lag time. &#8220;Crisp&#8221; is a good word.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m using a Powerbook G4 1.33ghz computer so it&#8217;s reasonably quick, but under 10.3 it still slugged along occasionally. That&#8217;s no longer the case. The difference between 10.3 and 10.4 is very noticable.</p>

	<p>Apps are faster as well. The new versions of Safari and Mail pack some speed improvements, but I was astounded by the speed change in Firefox. It seems to pull down pages in an instant. iPhoto 5 is a lightyear better than iPhoto 4 under 10.3. The iTunes Music Store downloads pages in a flash under Tiger. All in all, it truly feels like I have high-speed Internet now.</p>

	<p><b>Visually interesting</b>: The new video technologies in this build are impressive. The interface can ripple and wave with no apparent hit to the performance. The new Quicktime 7 is beautiful. Quicktime videos have a polish I simply did not expect&#8212;they are crystal clear. If you have a widescreen powerbook or monitor, the QT7 features HD capabilities that will blow you away.</p>

	<p>Mind you, there are portions of the interface that I&#8217;d almost call ugly, Mail 2.0 for example. Hey you can&#8217;t win them all.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1217.html" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
