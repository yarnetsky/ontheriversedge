<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>IUPUI might as well have been closed today. Some sort of marathon was running in downtown Indianapolis and the student parking lot was shut down so the runners have somewhere to park. Do they not realize there are still classes on campus? </p>

	<p>According to our prof, they know, but decide to pick up the PR and good will as IUPUI is still fighting for an identity. </p>

	<p>So our prof relocated our class to the Glendale Mall on the northside of Indy. IUPUI has several classrooms in the mall and the Indianapolis-Marion County Public Library has a branch library there.</p>

	<p>I was looking foward to it as the mall library is supposed to be a shining example of the species. I peeked in and it indeed looked like a nice library. I was thinking about staying after class and working on my homework. But when the time came to stay I couldn&#8217;t shake the noise and the loud mariachi music being played in the mall. I started feeling claustrophobic and it felt like my soul was getting sucked out. </p>

	<p>I just don&#8217;t get it, I most of the time I just can&#8217;t stand being in a mall anymore. I have class there again next Saturday, maybe if I get a good night&#8217;s sleep my soul will be stout.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>Katrina, now just a tropical depression, is raining hard on us here in Madison. It seems like a normal rain, but just knowiing the literal hell on earth it has caused makes the rain seem worse than it is.</p>

	<p>It amazes me that even though New Orleans was spared the worst case scenario, the scene is still horrific. With the <a href="http://www.nola.com/hurricane/t-p/katrina.ssf?/hurricane/katrina/stories/083005catastrophic.html">levees now broken on Lake Pontchartrain</a> <br />
NO is in for a long haul that I doubt any hurricane pummelled community has had to survive. The mayor is saying some people may not be able to come home for weeks if not months. That said the coastal areas to the east are in no better shape.</p>

	<p>I think what gives me the willies (for the lack of a better word) are city streets full of toxic waste, poisonous snakes and fire ants. Welcome to the industrial swamp.</p>

	<p>Here&#8217;s a bizarre tidbit from the above <a href="http//www.nola.com">Times-Piqayune</a> of New Orleans. They&#8217;re doing a good job of covering the disaster.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>About 5 p.m., almost as if on cue, the battery power of all the house alarms in the neighborhood seemed to reach a critical level, and they all went off, making it sound as if the area was under an air-raid warning. Two men surviving on generator power in the Lake Terrace neighborhood near the Lake Pontchartrain levee still had a dry house, but they were watching the rising water in the yard nervously. They were planning to head out to retrieve a vast stash of beer, champagne and hard liquor they found washed onto the levee. As night fell, the sirens of house alarms finally fell silent, and the air filled with a different, deafening and unfamiliar sound: the extraordinary din of thousands of croaking frogs.</p>

	<p>Greg is a fellow Madisonian, blogger (<a href="http://openstacks.net/os/archives/000849.html#000849">OpenStacks.net</a>) and librarian so this news ranks front page coverage in my opinion. </p>

	<p>So Greg, will your library and info sciences blog have a list of recommended books for fathers to read their kids? Think about it, as a librarian, blogger and father, the sky&#8217;s the limit!</p>

<strong>Update</strong>: Wow! Another bibliokid! Blake, the great guy who runs <a href="http://www.lisnews.com">LISNews</a> and <a href="http//www.lishost.com">LISHost</a> is also a new father&#8212;<a href="http://www.lisnews.com/articles/05/08/23/1416223.shtml?tid=33">Welcome Kelly!!</a>

<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1130.html" title="Cincinnati Union Terminal"> Cincinnati Union Terminal</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>As I start fall semester this week, Darlene and I decided to flee Madison one last time and went to Cincinnati. We did a little shopping (I finally visited <a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1110.html">Costco</a> and got some Perry Ellis chinos for $20) and went to the <a href="http://www.cincimuseum.org">Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal</a> to see an exhibit on space travel.</p>

	<p>While I enjoyed the exhibit, I love <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Museum_Center_at_Union_Terminal">Union Terminal.</a> This train palace is an art deco dream and I highly recommend a visit. Since 1990 it has been home to the Cincinnati Museum of Natural History, Cincinnati Museum of History and the Cincinnati Children&#8217;s Museum as well as an Omnimax theatre.</p>

	<p>But the terminal itself would be worth the trip. Check out these <a href="http://www.railstations.org/stations/us/oh/cut/photos/index.htm">photos from RailStatons.org,</a> especially the <a href="http://www.railstations.org/stations/us/oh/cut/photos/rotunda.htm">rotunda</a>. <br />
The glass fronted rotunda is 10-stories tall with a ceiling of silver, yellow and orange bands. Murals and marble circle the perimeter of the lobby.</p>

	<p>We closed down the <a href="http://www.cincymuseum.org/space_exhibit.asp">space exhibit</a> and we were just standing in the middle of the rotunda just drinking it all in when we started hearing voices. &#8220;Just let it go&#8230;&#8221; then a whirr and a clunk. The voices and the sounds were hanging in the air as if they were right next to us, but there was not a soul near us.</p>

	<p>It finally struck us that there was a coin vortex by the front door. It was at least 20 feet away, but we could hear every word and sound. What amazing acoustics!</p>

	<p>Another person told us that you could stand in one corner of the rotunda and hear a quiet voice in the other corner. Here&#8217;s a wonderful photo from <a href="http://www.gbphoto.com">Gordon Baer</a> that gives you an idea what I&#8217;m talking about.  </p>

<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1125.html" title="Still recovering from kids vacation"> Still recovering from kids vacation</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>One of these days I&#8217;ll recover from having all our nieces and nephews stay here. It was a lot of fun and I didn&#8217;t think about work, school, politics or the historic board for three whole days&#8212;a wonderful combination.</p>

<strong>One more tale</strong>. At the last minute Saturday night we decided to take the kids camping up at Clifty Falls State Park. It was a planned event, but there was a lot of hemming and hawing from all of us that resulted in a late start (in part as we were all tired from a day of swimming). Because of the late start, I put on my general&#8217;s hat and ordered them around (you find me some kindling for our fire, you help your mom with the tents, you find me newspaper). I suspect the kids took a temporary, but definite dislike for me. Mind you, I figured if I didn&#8217;t keep them mushing it&#8217;d get dark and we wouldn&#8217;t have a camp. I&#8217;m glad I did (even if they still don&#8217;t like me) because just as we got it set up, we saw lighting in the distance. I hoped it would pass us by as had about every storm this summer, but it was not to be.

	<p>Meanwhile, the youngest niece of the group, Shannon, decided she wanted to sleep in her own tent. We knew by now it was going to rain so we put her tent smack dab in front of ours so she could scurry into ours if desired.</p>

	<p>Well, the rain started and Darlene, being the true aunt she is, called out &#8220;you doing okay over there?&#8221; A definite &#8220;yes&#8221; came back along with singing of &#8220;rain, rain, go away.&#8221; The thunder got louder and louder and Shannon kept saying she was fine, indeed, it sounded like she was having fun. Yet, it was the loudest storm I&#8217;d been out in in years&#8230;and she was having fun?</p>

	<p>Suddenly the wind buffeted our tent significantly and that&#8217;s when she lost it. As the wind rattled everything, Darlene quickly went over and grabbed up her stuff and she crawled into our tent. About a minute later we looked out into the storm and her tent was gone&#8212;it literally blew away. Even though some of the gang stayed up into the wee hours of the morning wandering around, noone found the tent until the next morning nestled in the woods several camp sites away.</p>

	<p>The guys, meanwhile, were drown out of their tent (rain came in through the zippers&#8212;it was an old tent).  We found them asleep in our van. They slept only four hours. I think I got six.</p>

	<p>After breakfast I dragged them (not really they readily came) on a two hour hike down into a gorge and back up again. Then we went boating on the Ohio River and swimming again later that day.</p>

	<p>Now you get the idea why I&#8217;m tired.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>Darlene&#8217;s sister Carol visited with 6 of her 8 children over the weekend and boy did we party. We had a pizza and cards party Thursday night, took them to the Louisville Zoo on Friday, went swimming and camping on Saturday and then on Sunday we went on a rugged hike in the morning, then boating on the Ohio River and swimming again in the afternoon. </p>

	<p>I fell asleep last night at 7 p.m. and just woke up.</p>

	<p>The highlight was probably <a href="http://www.louisvillezoo.org/Lorikeet/Lorikeet-landing.htm">Lorikeet Landing</a> at the Louisville Zoo. One of the Zoo representatives said Lorikeets are very common in eastern Australia. Indeed, he said in Sydney they are the equivalent to our pigeons. A visiting zookeeper watched the amaziningly colored birds swamp picnickers in Sydney and came up with the brilliant idea of bringing them to a zoo. It is a wild time and certainly more entertaining than watching pigeons.</p>

	<p>When you go, you buy a $1 worth of nector and you&#8217;ll get swamped with birds, often battling each other for your nector. At one time I think I had eight birds perched on me, three of whom were pecking at each other for nector, one licking my neck and one nibbling on my beard. </p>

	<p>Meanwhile, one of the birds was pecking and pulling at my niece Julie&#8217;s earrings.</p>

	<p>To get a feel of the melee check out our <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/egyarnetsky/PhotoAlbum8.html">Lorikeet Landing photo album</a></p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>I <strong>finally</strong> finished my second summer session and I&#8217;m only waiting to get my grade from my final paper. I think my paper on &#8220;blogging for accessibility&#8221; turned out pretty decent. I may post it later to get some feedback on it.</p>

	<p>The treat I&#8217;m giving myself for surviving the summer is to move to a new blogging system. I got tired of my MovableType 2.66. I thought about upgrading to MT 3.1, but then I&#8217;d have to pay to do my wife&#8217;s website on it.</p>

	<p>So I am currently working on a move to <a href="http://www.textpattern.com">Textpattern</a> and should make the site live within a couple days. While it takes some getting used to, I&#8217;m enjoying the flexibility it&#8217;s provides. For example, having a sidebar blog is now very easy so I now have a place for short posts like mini-reviews and fun websites.</p>

	<p>The program is still under development, they are on a final candidate release and just locked down the features about a week ago. As a result, there are very few templates to work from so I cobbled a few of them together to get what I want. I figure I can be more creative on a future release. </p>

	<p>To get a feel for what people are doing with Textpattern, try a visit over to <a href="http://txpmagazine.kbbu.de/">TXP Magazine</a> and take a look at the <a href="http://txpmagazine.kbbu.de/all_sites/">sites collection</a>.</p>
