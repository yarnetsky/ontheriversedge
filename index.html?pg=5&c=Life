<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>Right now I feel like I was given one of those fortune cookies that read&#8212;&#8221;May you live in interesting times&#8221; or some such.</p>

	<p>Right now I&#8217;m in over my head with homework. In five weeks I&#8217;ve written more than 50 pages in papers and I have at least another dozen to go before I can quit next week. I think the last time I wrote that much in a short period of time was for our local paper during the 1997 flood.</p>

	<p>Either way, after this class I&#8217;ll be a third of the way toward a masters degree.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, I have once again shuffled myself into the middle of a historic preservation hullabaloo as a member of the Madison Historic District Board of Review.</p>

	<p>A property owner pre-meditatively violated our historic district ordinance after we turned him down for vinyl windows on his 19th century industrial/commercial building. All of the sudden, my name&#8217;s been in the paper about every other day and on local online forums.</p>

	<p>The board is in a bad position. One one hand we have a very weak ordinance with no design guidelines. On the other our community has a strong libertarian streak where people don&#8217;t like to be told what to do with their properties. It amazes me that through all this some people seem to think we enjoy doing what we do.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m learning to live with the notion I&#8217;ll be a punching bag for people&#8217;s views on preservation in Madison. However, I just hope people will continue allowing me to serve them in peace at the library (if that makes sense).</p>

  	<p>Darlene just got an email that the new Harry Potter book had shipped. &#8220;Shoot, I guess that means I won&#8217;t get it today. Oh, who knows maybe they&#8217;ll deliver it later. You can always hope.&#8221;</p>

	<p>Well, not 10 minutes later, I hear a light knock on the door. I had to scramble to get downstairs. The mailman was already down the street, but I managed to catch him.</p>

	<p>Of course, he hands me a box labeled &#8220;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I now have a happy potter reading Harry Potter&#8230;</p>

  	<p>I bought some new CDs for the first time in probably years. I had been promising Darlene some new jazz for a while and now that I&#8217;ve played a few tracks I think I chose well. Here&#8217;s what I snagged from <br />
<a href="http://www.houseohits.com/hoh/index.htm">House O&#8217; Hits Records</a>...</p>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Stay Loose&#8230;Jimmy Smith Sings Again</strong>: This guy is great on the Hammond B3 organ. One of his better albums from the 1960s.</li>
		<li><strong>The Definitive Chet Baker</strong>: So far I like his trumpet better than his vocals, but not bad when he combines the two. I bought this one on a whim.</li>
		<li><strong>Compact Jazz Lionel Hampton</strong>: This is not one of the better Hampton collections, but I love him on the vibraphone. Hey it was a used CD.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The test obviously is whether she&#8217;ll like them&#8230;</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>Madison has joined the big leagues of food. A new grocery open here downtown that offers organic food, fruit, vegatables, meats and cheeses. The variety is wonderful.</p>

	<p>Check out <a href="http://www.localharvestmarket.com">Local Harvest Market</a>. They&#8217;re planning an &#8220;e-market&#8221; that will open soon so you can get an idea of what they&#8217;re carrying.</p>

	<p>What amazes me is they even have FRESH fish flown in from the coast three times a week. I don&#8217;t know the last time I&#8217;ve had fresh fish. Also every kind of meat you can imagine&#8212;we can even get bison, rabbit and duck. If you have the opportunity, you should try organic free-range chicken eggs. They really are pretty amazing.</p>

	<p>They also have prepared meals. We had beef curry rice for dinner tonight. They also had grilled swordfish with pineapple and mango sauce. They&#8217;ll even make you sandwiches from fresh baked bread and premium Boar&#8217;s Head meats from their deli cut to order. I&#8217;m told sushi is also coming soon.</p>

	<p>I know one of the people who will be working there and she said they all attended workshops to learn about the products they&#8217;ll be selling. Indeed, she attended a fullday on just wines and cheeses.</p>

	<p>While I doubt I could afford to buy all my food there, but I am very much looking forward to sampling the fare, this will be fun&#8212;real food!</p>

<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/index.html?id=1094" title="Yesterday? homework. Today? homework. Tomorrow?"> Yesterday? homework. Today? homework. Tomorrow?</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>Well, tomorrow is class, but the day after that will be homework too.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m coming up on the end of my first summer session and I&#8217;m amazed at how much information is being squeezed into the short space. Having taken two 16-week courses and now one six-week course&#8212;I&#8217;d prefer quarters over semesters and summer sessions. I think the class is going pretty well, though I&#8217;m behind on the reading (what else is new).</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, Mother Nature is not helping me much here.</p>

	<p>We managed to get air conditioning in our building for the first time just as it hit 94.8 her downtown this week. However, I&#8217;d love to know what tree, mold or mite is doing me in. I&#8217;m having an extreme allergic reaction to something. I&#8217;m wanting to tear my eyes out and it feels like I&#8217;m breathing hot sands into my lungs.</p>

	<p>Some prescription eye drops I had left over from last summer&#8217;s allergy attack helped, but Claritin wasn&#8217;t doing the trick so I went in to see the doctor today.</p>

	<p>He didn&#8217;t tell me anything I didn&#8217;t already know&#8212;I&#8217;m joining the thousands who are suffering from the Ohio River Valley Crud. ORVC is a catch-all malady that is suffered at vaying times of year by valley residents. It typifies the valley as a cauldron of allergies and sinus junk.</p>

	<p>Mind you, I didn&#8217;t like the prescription&#8212;my insurance charged me $40 for Zyrtec-D and I have to take corticosteroid hormone junk for my lungs starting in the morning. While I really didn&#8217;t like the side effect from the last time I had to take the stuff, I&#8217;ll take that over not breathing. It&#8217;s indeed like the billboard about asthma, it is kind of like being a fish out of water.</p>

<h2><a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/index.html?id=1092" title="Wanderlust and Memorial Day weekend"> Wanderlust and Memorial Day weekend</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>When Darlene and I were in college we wandered just about every road in western Ohio. Once we got out of college, other than vacation, we lost the wanderlust.</p>

	<p>But now that I&#8217;m driving back and forth to Indy every week I&#8217;ve regained my wanderlust. There&#8217;s only so many times you can drive down I-65 without getting sick of it. There&#8217;s just something satisfying about being on the road not yet traveled.</p>

	<p>As a result I&#8217;m finding about every way to drive from Indy to Madison. So far I&#8217;d say my favorite is Indiana 3 between Greensburg and North Vernon. It was a very &#8220;springy-Hoosierish&#8221; day. Barns sitting out in deep green rolling fields. Just nice.</p>

	<p>After class on Friday, we went to visit Darlene&#8217;s family near Lima, Ohio, for the holiday. We drove up from Indy to Marion and then went straight east through the flat farmlands of eastern Indiana. The fields were huge, going from the road back at least a mile in every direction before you hit a stand of trees. Wheat fields are starting to grow.</p>

	<p>We crossed into Ohio going over the Wabash River (yes Hoosiers, it starts in Ohio) and over to Grand Lake St. Mary&#8217;s. The largest inland lake in Ohio, it was created to be the resevoir for the Miami-Erie Canal. The lake is an impossible blue. I&#8217;d only seen photos that blue somewhere in the Caribbean. The lake is flanked by Celina and St. Mary&#8217;s, Both are nice towns. Celina is the resort town of the two with nice homes and condos line the lake. St. Mary&#8217;s was the canal town with fragments of the Miami-Erie still flowing through town.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s great to wander. It helps cures the urge to runaway from home when I need to be studying.</p>

	<p>The weekend has been fun. I have managed to get a chunk of reading for class done, but we&#8217;ve also done a good share of partying with her family.</p>

	<p>We went to a &#8220;school&#8217;s out for summer&#8221; party at Darlene&#8217;s sister&#8217;s house and helped watch about 40 kids party. Two of her sister&#8217;s kids are in a hard rock garage band and heard them play last night. Of course, they were indeed playing in the garage. They were really good considering the oldest was only 15.</p>

	<p>Today about half the family came out to her parents&#8217; house. Two of my brothers-in-law and I played a couple hours of frisbee golf. Here&#8217;s a typical hole for us&#8230; We&#8217;d start from the bed of Stan&#8217;s pickup truck, throw down across the back field into a dried pond, back across the barley field and into the compost bin, back up the field and into the corn wagon bin finally tosing the frisbee through the front window of the pickup to complete the hole. I had a 15 on that hole. We didn&#8217;t play a par anything the whole game.</p>

	<p>Toss in a really moist turkey and two pretty decent car races and it&#8217;s a been a pretty good Memorial Day weekend. Mind you I have another chunk of homework before we&#8217;ll head home tomorrow.</p>
