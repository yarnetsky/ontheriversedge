<div class="post">

<div class="entrytext">

	<p>While there wasn&#8217;t a so-called &#8220;bounce&#8221; from the convention on the national level, there are some pretty amazing trends developing. Indeed, I&#8217;m starting to smell blood.</p>

	<p>Kerry, while not perfect, has been clearly enjoying himself and attracting astoundingly large crowds during his cross-country tour.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, the Bush campaign has been a whimper and seems to be on the verge of panic. (Though for equal opportunity, they&#8217;re saying the Kerry campaign is in panic mode).</p>

	<p>Take Oregon.</p>

	<p>The photos from Kerry&#8217;s rally in Portland look more like the Simon &#38; Garfunkle Central Park concert than they do a political rally&#8230; more than 50,000 people showed up in the Rose City&#8230;. 50,000.</p>

	<p>In contrast, the Bush campaign hands out tickets to a select citizens who sign pledges to vote for Bush and has police filter out anyone wearing questionable clothing. Lord forbid if a Democrat or Libertarian were to slipping in. He then holds a scripted &#8220;question and answer&#8221; session.</p>

	<p>Choices of campaign stops is also interesting. Both Kerry and Bush are visiting swing states, but Kerry is visiting Republican cities.</p>

	<p>The <a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com">electoral college</a> is looking very bad for Bush right now&#8212;327-211 Kerry.</p>

	<p>Obviously, swing states such as Ohio, Missouri and Minnesota can swing, but Bush is having trouble holding a lead in states that should be solid Red by now&#8212;we&#8217;re talking North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas and McCain&#8217;s Arizona. In Florida, Kerry holds a 47-41 lead.</p>

	<p>Bush&#8217;s &#8220;America&#8217;s turning a corner&#8221; stump speech was pulled because jobs numbers took a surprising downward turn and we&#8217;ll end up with about 1,000 dead Americans in Iraq by time the GOP convention comes around. Meanwhile, we still haven&#8217;t heard word one of his second term agenda other than allusions to eliminating the income tax and war with Iran.</p>

	<p>The result is that we&#8217;re watching slime fly everywhere. They&#8217;re trying to slime Kerry&#8217;s well documented war record (as opposed to Bush who still can&#8217;t prove he wasn&#8217;t AWOL) and they&#8217;re pulling a &#8220;Fox&#8221; by taking Kerry&#8217;s words out of context for slime material.</p>

	<p>All signs of panic.</p>

	<p>Mind you, he still has his convention. While his State of the Union fell flat on its face (do you still hear about Mars?), he may come up with something. There are also in unpredictables. So who knows&#8230;</p>

	<p>Kerry still needs to fight like he&#8217;s behind, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if this is the start of something bigger. Much bigger.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1217.html" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve just read <a href="http://www.xanga.com/zenlib/454821264/major-breakthrough-with-information-overload.html">The Cure for Information Overload</a>. It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
