<div class="entry">


        
	<p>As you may recall, I took a class entitled &#8220;Technology and Resources for Patrons with Special Needs.&#8221; Part of the class is to freely explore issues relating to disabilities and bringing your research home to libraries if possible. </p>

	<p>As the remainders of Hurricane Dennis rolled over Madison, I wrote about how natural disasters impact people with disabilities. Now that Katrina simply devestated New Orleans, I&#8217;m reminded of the assignment.</p>

	<p>The assignment took the shape of an informal journal (I wrote other entries as well that I may share). Thus, even though I wrote it for a grad school, this is not really academic writing. Then again is it possible to get academic writing out of a former-journalist hack such as myself?</p>

	<p>The paper is on the flip side&#8230;</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.ontheriversedge.com/index.php?id=1141" title="Killer Kat is raining on us"> Killer Kat is raining on us</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>Katrina, now just a tropical depression, is raining hard on us here in Madison. It seems like a normal rain, but just knowiing the literal hell on earth it has caused makes the rain seem worse than it is.</p>

	<p>It amazes me that even though New Orleans was spared the worst case scenario, the scene is still horrific. With the <a href="http://www.nola.com/hurricane/t-p/katrina.ssf?/hurricane/katrina/stories/083005catastrophic.html">levees now broken on Lake Pontchartrain</a> <br />
NO is in for a long haul that I doubt any hurricane pummelled community has had to survive. The mayor is saying some people may not be able to come home for weeks if not months. That said the coastal areas to the east are in no better shape.</p>

	<p>I think what gives me the willies (for the lack of a better word) are city streets full of toxic waste, poisonous snakes and fire ants. Welcome to the industrial swamp.</p>

	<p>Here&#8217;s a bizarre tidbit from the above <a href="http//www.nola.com">Times-Piqayune</a> of New Orleans. They&#8217;re doing a good job of covering the disaster.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>About 5 p.m., almost as if on cue, the battery power of all the house alarms in the neighborhood seemed to reach a critical level, and they all went off, making it sound as if the area was under an air-raid warning. Two men surviving on generator power in the Lake Terrace neighborhood near the Lake Pontchartrain levee still had a dry house, but they were watching the rising water in the yard nervously. They were planning to head out to retrieve a vast stash of beer, champagne and hard liquor they found washed onto the levee. As night fell, the sirens of house alarms finally fell silent, and the air filled with a different, deafening and unfamiliar sound: the extraordinary din of thousands of croaking frogs.</p>

  	<p><blockquote>C reported on his recent talks in Washington. There was a perceptible shift in attitude. Military action was now seen as inevitable. Bush wanted to remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy. The NSC had no patience with the UN route, and no enthusiasm for publishing material on the Iraqi regime&#8217;s record. There was little discussion in Washington of the aftermath after military action.</blockquote></p>

	<p><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1593607,00.html">&#8212;From the secret Downing St. memo. 23 July 2002</a></p>

	<p>Since the runup to Iraq War there were complaints about the intelligence being cherry picked to pave the way toward war.</p>

	<p>Casual indications said they were right. The Niger yellowcake story fell apart. The former treasury secretary reporting that Bushies were planning war against Iraq within weeks of Inauguration. U.S. government confirmation that there were no weapons of mass destruction.</p>

	<p>Finally, on 1 May 2005 The Times of London dropped  a bombshell in the form of a secret British memo (linked above) by a foreign Blair foreign policy aide.</p>

	<p>The memo, minutes from a high-level British policy meeting, stated that evidence for war was being fixed.  Amazing isn&#8217;t it?</p>

	<p>The story was huge internationally, but until today it seemed only the Knight-Ridder papers had picked up on the story.</p>

	<p>Today, in response to 89 Democratic house members demanding an explanation did CNN <a title="CNN.com - Bush asked to explain UK war memo - May 11, 2005" href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/05/11/britain.war.memo/index.html">finally cover the story</a>&#8212;10 days later. Indeed, the Democratic letter was released on May 6.</p>

	<p>WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE THEY SITTING ON THEIR HANDS FOR? The corporate conservative media is at it again.</p>

	<p>What amazes me was that not only did the memo nail the fixing of intelligence, but the fact we were telling the British war was inevitable before Bush told the American people that it wasn&#8217;t.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s not enough to impeach Bush, but it certainly is enough for me to lay the blood of tens of thousands at his feet. I&#8217;m sick of the lies and I&#8217;m sick of a media that won&#8217;t ask questions.</p>

	<p>Thus I present to you (a day late) a great read from The New York Times: <a title="The New York Times > Sports > Baseball > An Old Baseball April Fools&#8217; Hoax&#8221; href=&#8221;http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/01/sports/baseball/01finch.html?8hpib=&#38;pagewanted=all&#38;position=&#8221;>An Old Baseball April Fools&#8217; Hoax</a> (Free registration required).</p>

	<p>It now ranks right up there with the Silver Lake Sea Serpant as my favorite alltime hoax. Sidd Finch lives!</p>
