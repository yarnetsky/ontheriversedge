  	<p>According to the local paper we got 17 inches of snow. The temperature has not plunged yet so we walked around town and took about 80 photos with our digital camera.</p>

	<p>Here are 21 of our favorite <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/egyarnetsky/PhotoAlbum2.html">photos</a> of the morning. [<b>UPDATE</b>: <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/egyarnetsky/PhotoAlbum3.html">More photos</a>] Click on any of the photos to start the slide show. Click on any of the slide photo shots for a bigger image.</p>

	<p>Mind you, after a while you can only take so many photos of white stuff covering stuff.</p>

	<p>it is supposed to get very windy and very cold over the next couple of days. Tonight they&#8217;re calling for 3 above, a high of 11 tomorrow and -7 on Christmas eve. Wind chill of -25. ugh.  If it get&#8217;s that cold, it looking like we may well skip going to family in Ohio for Christmas.</p>

	<p>We got a call from Darlene&#8217;s sister who said her husband, a truck drive, has been stuck all night at a truck stop just north of Findlay, Ohio. Poor guy. They have blizzard advisory right now.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>I really need to get down to see the river. I think I&#8217;ll get up early to do so tomorrow. The Ohio takes on a very different look when it is high. If it wasn&#8217;t for the rushing water, it would seem more like a lake.</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s around the 444 foot level with flood stage at 451. It&#8217;s peaking now and is supposed to be down to 440 by Friday, still a bank full, but definitely no flooding.</p>

	<p>Darlene said it&#8217;s a mess down there. Tons of debris floating down river. She said she thought she saw a &#8216;fridge float down. Our daily newspaper&#8217;s photographer told her he thought he saw an outhouse. Lots of barrels and trees.</p>

	<p>Lots of people have been down by the river watching it go by. Guys sitting at the side of the street fishing&#8212;normally you&#8217;d have to walk <strong>down</strong> a good 20 feet to get to the river. Nearby, E.G. (the Egyptian goose on the riverfront, not me) was huddling with his new found cohort Aneg (ANother Egyptian Goose). All the geese were displaced to parkland across the street.</p>

	<p>It seems sad that we&#8217;re watching the river flow by with an odd fascination as towns in Pennsylvania, W.Virginia and North Carolina are getting swept away by the remnents of Ivan. We didn&#8217;t get the rain so there is a disconnect when we watch the swollen river.</p>

	<p>You have to understand that this is an area where we get dafodils and tulips in mid-March. Winter end there.</p>

	<p>But on Tuesday it snowed, covering blooming dogwoods and redbuds with heavy, slushy snow.</p>

	<p>While I was attending the Indiana Library Federation annual conference in Indianapolis, an odd front moved through that dumped 2-6 inches of really wet, heavy snow along the Ohio River valley upriver from Louisville.</p>

	<p>My boss and I were driving down I-65 when it started raining hard as we left Indy. Sometime after we passed Columbus, Ind., Charlene asked &#8220;what is that stuff.&#8221; The white stuff was only in patches, but as we drove further south it piled up.</p>

	<p>By the time we got off the Interstate onto IN-256 it was obvious we had a mid-spring snow storm. Cars and trucks were spun off the road. Soon we caught up to the snow plow that sent plumes of snow (and several trash cans) 20 feet into the air.</p>

	<p>The bushes were heavy with snow, green leaves and flowers pokes out from the snow. It was quite beautiful.</p>

	<p>I wish I had actually witnessed the event unstead of the after effects.</p>

	<p>Darlene said it started with rain and turned to a heavy sleet. Soon silver dollar-sized flakes fell in the heaviest snow seen the whole year.</p>

	<p>Darlene said her favorite, though sad episode of the snow was a police car who flew down Main Street toward a wreck on the west end of town. As he crossed the railroad bridge, he hit black ice, spun out and hit a car. That car hit another car and that car hit a house.</p>

	<p>The next morning I biked to work, the snow was already gone a mid-spring night&#8217;s dream.</p>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>When we saw an Egyptian goose  on our riverfront (photo at left) we were curious how a native African bird could end up on the Ohio River. <a https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/archives/000274.html">(read earlier post)</a></p>

	<p>Thus I sent an email to the Louisville Zoo asking if they had an idea how he could have gotten here.</p>

	<p>Here is the response:</p>

	<p><blockquote>Mr. Yarnetsky, I have just received an answer from our lead Bird-keeper, Mr. Johnson.</p>

	<p>Yes, the photo is indeed an Egyptian goose. Mr. Johnson does not think that it is from the Zoo.  Egyptian Geese are pretty common in Kentucky through mail order companies.  They are usually also found for sale at the Kentucky State Fair each week.</p>

	<p>Good eye in spotting the bird!<br />
Gary Michael</blockquote></p>

	<p>An unusual find, but apparently not THAT unusual. We&#8217;ll take a sacred Egyptian bird on our riverfront nonetheless.</p>

  	<p>We definitely have been enjoying the milder weather. I&#8217;m biking to work again and Darlene&#8217;s out walking the riverfront daily. After a said walk, she reported to me there was a pretty neat bird skulking along with our local flock of mallards, Canada geese and other domestic fowl that like hanging out where people toss free food.</p>

	<p>As it hit 60 today, we took the camera for some birding. Lo and behold, there was a pretty neat bird sitting on the banks of the Ohio.</p>

	<p><img alt="Egyptian goose" src="http://www.ontheriversedge.com/archives/egyptian.jpg" border="0" /></p>

	<p>What&#8217;s weird however, is this bird, an <a href="http://www.zoo.org/educate/fact_sheets/savana/egoose.htm">Egyptian Goose</a>, does not belong here. It&#8217;s not even in a migratory pattern through here. It&#8217;s supposed to be living in the Nile valley, the sub-Sahara or Western Europe. While common in Africa, it&#8217;s a sacred bird in Egypt.</p>

	<p>Where this Egyptian Goose came from is anyone&#8217;s guess. There&#8217;s good odds it has escaped from a zoo or private collection.</p>

	<p>Maybe he&#8217;s slowly working its way down the Ohio to Cairo, Ill., thinking its heading to Cairo, Egypt, on the Nile.</p>

	<p>Hey, it&#8217;s name starts with my initials and we found it &#8220;on the rivers edge&#8221; so for now he&#8217;s my website mascot.</p>

	<p>Jane and Michael Stern have traveled the country ump-teen times over the past couple of decades sampling the best food from backroad and Main Street restaurants. The result was &#8220;Roadfood&#8221; a pretty cool compendium of good eats.</p>
