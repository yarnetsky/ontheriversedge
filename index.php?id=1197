<div class="entrytext">

	<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is a post from my wife Darlene.</p>
	<p>I, like many, have been following the stories from the areas that were hit by hurricane Katrina.  Recently I read a story telling of bodies still &#8211; 6 months later &#8211; being found in houses in New Orleans.  Another story in the past few weeks told of evacuees still waiting for promised FEMA trailers.  This nightmare is not over for many.  </p>
	<p>About four days before hurricane Katrina, I visited the website of the New Orleans newspaper, the <a href="http://www.nola.com">Times-Picayune</a>.  There I found a series of articles published in 2002 that is still online.  The topic?  Titled <a href="http://www.nola.com/hurricane/?/washingaway/">Washing Away</a>, the series was an in-depth depiction of the consequences of a major hurricane hitting New Orleans. It was all there, the failing of the levees, the storm surge predictions, the history of hurricanes that have hit the area in the past, the lack of transportation available for residents to evacuate. The series showed in detail, complete with graphics, the likelihood of a major hurricane hitting New Orleans, and the probable results.</p>
	<p>As the newspaper put it:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>It&#8217;s a matter of when, not if. Eventually a major hurricane will hit New Orleans head on, instead of being just a close call. It&#8217;s happened before and it&#8217;ll happen again.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>As a city that is located below sea level, the dangers were obvious, and the &#8220;big one&#8221; was an ongoing topic in the area, much as Californians await the big earthquake.  Early in 2005, the National Weather Service predicted a busier hurricane season than usual with a number of strong storms. Hurricane Katrina moved into the gulf on Friday August 26th, 3 days before coming ashore in the US for the second time. As it passed through southern Florida, the predictions of it becoming a major hurricane fueled by the perfect conditions in the warm gulf began:</p>
	<p>From the National Hurricane center on the 26th:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>GIVEN THE RAPID IMPROVEMENT IN THE INNER CORE STRUCTURE AND THE SHARP PRESSURE DROP&#8230;RAPID INTENSIFICATION SEEMS LIKELY FOR THE NEXT 12 HOURS OR SO. AFTERWARDS&#8230;STEADY INTENSIFICATION TO NEAR CATEGORY FOUR STRENGTH BY 72 HOURS APPEARS TO BE IN ORDER GIVEN THE VERY WARM GULF WATERS BENEATH THE HURRICANE AND THE VERTICAL SHEAR FORECAST TO DECREASE TO LESS THAN 10 KT BY 48 HOURS.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>The warnings put out by the National Weather Service were detailed and ominous.</p>
	<p>This from Sunday the 28th&#8230;</p>
 <blockquote> MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS ARE NEAR 160 MPH&#8230;WITH HIGHER GUSTS. KATRINA IS A POTENTIALLY CATASTROPHIC CATEGORY FIVE HURRICANE ON THE SAFFIR-SIMPSON SCALE. SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN STRENGTH ARE LIKELY PRIOR TO LANDFALL&#8230;AND KATRINA IS EXPECTED TO MAKE LANDFALL AT CATEGORY FOUR OR FIVE INTENSITY. WINDS AFFECTING THE UPPER FLOORS OF HIGH-RISE BUILDINGS WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY STRONGER THAN THOSE NEAR GROUND LEVEL.
	<p>KATRINA IS A LARGE HURRICANE.  HURRICANE FORCE WINDS EXTEND OUTWARD UP TO 105 MILES FROM THE CENTER&#8230;AND TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS EXTEND OUTWARD UP TO 230 MILES.  SUSTAINED TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS ARE ALREADY OCCURRING OVER THE SOUTHEAST LOUISIANA COAST.  </p>
	<p>A NOAA HURRICANE HUNTER PLANE REPORTED A MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE OF 904 MB&#8230;26.69 INCHES.</p>
	<p>COASTAL STORM SURGE FLOODING OF 18 TO 22 FEET ABOVE NORMAL TIDE LEVELS&#8230;LOCALLY AS HIGH AS 28 FEET&#8230;ALONG WITH LARGE AND DANGEROUS BATTERING WAVES&#8230;CAN BE EXPECTED NEAR AND TO THE EAST OF WHERE THE CENTER MAKES LANDFALL.  SOME LEVEES IN THE GREATER NEW ORLEANS AREA COULD BE OVERTOPPED.  SIGNIFICANT STORM SURGE FLOODING WILL OCCUR ELSEWHERE ALONG THE CENTRAL AND NORTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO COAST.</blockquote> </p>
	<p>So while our president said just days after the hurricane, that no one anticipated the levees would be breached, that was obviously not the case.</p>
	<p>Before I continue, let me make one thing clear.  Though I am no fan of President Bush, I am appalled at the hurricane response at all levels.  There is enough failure and blame to go around.  Why I am particularly disturbed by the comments of President Bush, however, is that this one comment shows a either a lack of awareness, an ignorance that is disturbing to see in our top leader, or it shows a callous disregard for the facts and the truth of the catastrophy that killed over a thousand of our citizens.</p>
	<p>I was extremely angry at the time to hear the reporting of the falsehood of no one anticipating the levees failing.  I still am, but the reports that were published by the Associated Press the other evening, and the video of the news conference clearly show that president Bush was informed- in detail &#8211; of the threat before the arrival of the hurricane.  Michael Brown, for all of his supposed failings clearly understood the danger facing New Orleans from the storm, and President Bush was warned by him and others  of what was coming.  </p>
	<p>If you haven&#8217;t already seen this on the news, it is posted by a number of news sources on the web.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content//video/2006/03/01/VI2006030101864.html">Link to video from the Washington Post</a></p>
	<p>This story and video was covered on all major news networks. FEMA and Homeland Security definitely need to be organized better and as I said earlier there is  enough blame to go around.  Because Katrina touched all of us and hurt so many of our people, I feel that we all need to be informed of what really happened in the  response.  We cannot stop a hurricane, but we can insist &#8211; from all of our leaders &#8211; on better care for our fellow citizens in need.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/index.php?id=1217" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>
