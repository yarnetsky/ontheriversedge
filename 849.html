<div class="post">

<div class="entrytext">

	<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/17/opinion/polls/main593849.shtml">The latest CBS News/NY Times poll</a> has Bush taking a big drop in the latest approval polls to equal the lowest of his administration.</p>

	<p>On one hand the constant polling of America drive me crazy because it makes it too easy for reporters to write &#8220;horse race&#8221; stories during an election year.</p>

	<p>However, I find it interesting that his two latest &#8220;think big&#8221; initiatives are falling flat.</p>

	<p>The proposed immigration policy appears to have hit a raw nerve. Several of our more conservative friends are mad as hornets over the proposal. Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t get to talk to them long enough to find out why.</p>

	<p>If the economy hadn&#8217;t dumped 3 million jobs, I think people would be more open to his proposal. Even if the competition for jobs is more imagined than real, people are feeling defensive.</p>

	<p>Nonetheless, I agree the United States needs to rethink it&#8217;s immigration policies. On a simple human rights basis, it&#8217;s sad that people subject themselves to near death experiences to make it here.</p>

	<p>Also, as much as I hate to say it, I agree with Bush that there are jobs people no longer want to take.</p>

	<p>Why are there jobs Americans don&#8217;t want? I think there are several elements at work.</p>

	<p>First off, we&#8217;re consuming more and more and wanting more and more services.</p>

	<p>&#8220;Hello, welcome to Taco Bell, would you like to try our new bean, cheese and rice burrito today?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;No thank you, I&#8217;ll take a 7-Layer Burrito please.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Would you like hot or mild sauce with that?<br />
&#8220;No thank you&#8221;<br />
&#8220;That&#8217;ll be $1.73, please pull around&#8221;</p>

	<p>In this scenario, the kid on the other side of the microphone knows there&#8217;s 10 more jobs just like this one waiting for him if he wants to quit tomorrow. A couple of our friends who run restaurants have learned this one the hard way.</p>

	<p>Then there is Walmart.</p>

	<p>Walmart is getting us great prices. I admit that I find it hard to pay $4 for a box of cereal at Krogers when I know I can get the same box for $2.75 at Wally World. I just don&#8217;t make enough to pay $4 for cereal.</p>

	<p>Yet, there is a flip side to this. To give us great prices, Walmart is pushing down wages everywhere else. Not only what it pays its own employees, but also what it&#8217;s willing to pay suppliers for goods.</p>

	<p>The suppliers in turn, to make a profit, can&#8217;t pay its employees all that much. For agriculture, this means immigrants. For manufacturing, it means going overseas.</p>

	<p>Because neither the service economy jobs, nor the Walmart jobs pay diddly, people are less willing to take them&#8212;unless they don&#8217;t have the option.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, we also know a lot people who don&#8217;t have the option to turn down Walmart jobs as Madison does not have many well paying jobs either.</p>

	<p>Again, if we hadn&#8217;t lost so many jobs in the past couple of years, people wouldn&#8217;t even think about these jobs. But today, I think they are.</p>

	<p>But then there are the minority who believe they&#8217;re the only true Americans and that immigration should be cut. I won&#8217;t tell them that they&#8217;re only the fourth-generation to live on our soil if you won&#8217;t.</p>

	<p>Personally, I like immigration. It keeps this country vibrant. We&#8217;re getting a decent number of Latinos and Asians coming into town and I think it&#8217;s exciting that our pleasent, though white bread, community is getting a little diversity.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1217.html" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
