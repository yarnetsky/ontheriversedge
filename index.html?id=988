	<p>Darlene and I visited her parents this weekend. It was a rather interesting weekend to say the least. On one hand it was fun playing with all the nieces and nephews, on the other hand it was a rather political weekend.</p>

	<p>Darlene has a split family politically. Her parents are labor Democrats. Two of her sisters are voting for Kerry and the other two are voting for Bush (last time around it was 3-1 Bush I believe). Who knows about her brothers. One would probably vote for Bush, but isn&#8217;t planning on voting.</p>

	<p>Now you know I can get on my high horse and rant away. Darlene is hotter about this election than I am. Her father is twice as growly as Darlene. He has been railing against Bush for three years now, yet oddly he had no plans on voting this year &#8220;Why bother? He&#8217;ll steal the election anyway.&#8221;</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m not sure when the last time he had voted. Maybe the 1968 &#8220;Humphrey/Muskie&#8221; sticker out in his barn gives me a clue. I told him I wouldn&#8217;t listen to him complain about Bush unless he actually cast a ballot this year. I don&#8217;t think he believed me until I downloaded the registration forms off the Internet. I think that did it. He actually filled them out and sent them in.</p>

	<p>You notice I said &#8220;them.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t expect my mother-in-law to vote. I&#8217;ve never heard her comment one line about politics in more than 15 years, but during our last visit she said she wanted to vote for Kerry. She had not voted for at least 30 years.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, their registrations were somehow split up. His reached Wapakoneta on Oct. 4 and he sent in their absentee ballot requests soon thereafter. His was granted and hers was not. They said she wasn&#8217;t registered.</p>

	<p>Well at their request, I called the Board of Elections and found out that her registration didn&#8217;t arrive until Oct. 18, after her request was rejected.</p>

	<p>So, Darlene and I had the honor of taking her mom into town to vote for the first time in an eon. While I was at it, I hand delivered her father&#8217;s ballot to the election board. Two votes for Kerry banked in Ohio.</p>

	<p>On the way home we found the Auglaize County Democratic Headquarters open. We stopped and got all kinds of goodies. We got her father a Kerry yard sign. We got a Kerry bumper sticker for our new van and each of us got a Kerry button. Finally, I landed two tickets for today&#8217;s Edwards rally in Lima, not far from where two of her sisters live.</p>

	<p>That night we had a very good turkey for dinner and three of Darlene&#8217;s sisters came. Politics was obviously the main topic of conversation. I think Darlene was begging for it by wearing her Kerry pin in mixed company.</p>

	<p>My wonderful brother-in-law said he believed Bush was the &#8220;moral&#8221; candidate. What can I say, I lost it on him, lying about war is not moral, Abu Ghraib is not moral, handing down debt and a dirty planet to my nieces and nephews is not moral, instituting Jim Crow type election supression is not moral. Either way, once the ice was broken though, we all had a very civilized, even fun political conversation.</p>

	<p>Finally, after everyone went home, we were about to go to bed for the night. It was late and we had to get up early for the four hour drive so I could get to work by 12:30 today.</p>

	<p>It was at that point that her father put &#8220;Fahrenheit  9-11&#8221; into the DVD player. After watching the first 10 minutes were were absolutely hooked. We couldn&#8217;t stop watching it.</p>

	<p>I think it could have been better. There were some connections that could have been made clearer, but the overall impact left me literally shaking. Listening to the parents of the dead soldiers was absolutely heart breaking.</p>

	<p>It amazed me that not five months before the 9-11, just about every administration official said, on camera, that Saddam was not a threat. Their story certainly changed. They conveniently took good advantage of the news.</p>

	<p>Watching the scenes from Iraq was enlightening. People have told me they do not believe we should know what&#8217;s going on in a war zone. They don&#8217;t believe reporters should be there. I disagree, especially after watching the movie. I think everyone should witness a little bit of the carnage. It&#8217;s good for the soul to see our soldiers put their lives and souls on the line for us. It&#8217;s good for the soul to see the real impact of war.</p>

	<p>Finally, we just heard back from her sister who attended this afternoon&#8217;s Edwards rally and she sent us a few photos. She said they had a great time. I look forward to hearing what their reaction to Edwards was.</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/index.html?id=1217" title="Permanent link to this article">Fireworks in Madison</a></h3>
	<p>We have a small fireworks show each Regatta week on the Ohio River. It&#8217;s nothing extravegant, but it&#8217;s fun. You can watch the reflections on the river, but we were on our roof a couple blocks away.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing is listening to the explosions reverberate forever off our 400-foot bluffs. This year&#8217;s finale was punctuated by dozens of such explosions which made for a very satisfying ending.</p>

It&#8217;s a rather interesting work for anyone who deals with a boatload of information from librarians to people, like me, who read way too many websites when they should be doing their homework.</p>
