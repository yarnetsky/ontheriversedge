  	<p>My opportunity for futzing with my website is coming to an end. My online class starts Wednesday, Darlene has some appointments and sinus surgery coming up this week and I have class on Friday in Indy. Thus, no more futzing.</p>
	<p>Either way, my latest futz is a new photo page that falls within the template of the overall blog. Before the galleries were off site. I&#8217;m not <em>entirely</em> happy with the results, but it&#8217;s not bad. Creating the gallery is simple. The photos, on the other hand, take forever to prep. I&#8217;m just thinking there is an easier way of doing it.</p>
	<p>The first two galleries are from a recent weekend getaway to New Harmony, Indiana.</p>
	<p>So why are you still here? Go over to my new <a href="/?s=photos">photo page</a>.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m definitely not done, but I like the concept. I&#8217;d like to give the background more depth and the text colors need work.</p>
	<p>That said, what do you think so far? Yes, you may say &#8220;the design is so 2001&#8221; or other such slams. </p>

A committee of the International Astronomical Union has <a href="http://www.iau2006.org/mirror/www.iau.org/iau0601/iau0601_release.html">proposed a new definition of planets</a> that could bring in more than a dozen smaller planets to the solar system that they&#8217;re calling plutons.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>It makes sense, Stern said, that there could be dozens of planets in the solar system. The discoveries in the Kuiper Belt have put Pluto in context, he said. &#8220;Pluto is no longer the misfit,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is closer to average than the Earth.&#8221;</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>The news sent real estate prices skyrocketing on the eight major planets as Solians moved en mass trying to avoid the  stigma of living on a pluton. </p>
	<p>One buyer moved from Ceres to Mars after his Martian friends taunted him. &#8220;Before we were the king of the asteriod belt, now we&#8217;re a measly pluton. My friends harassed me saying I was nothing more than a backwater pluton hick. It was awful. I&#8217;ll miss Ceres, I so much liked small planet life.&#8221; </p>

<h2><a href="https://yarnetsky.github.io/ontheriversedge/1221.html" title="Bloody brilliant!"> Bloody brilliant!</a></h2>

<div class="entry">


     

  	<p>Well, classes ended for the summer last Saturday and since then I&#8217;ve watched more television than I have in the past year.</p>
	<p>I ordered the new <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/episodes/2005/">Doctor Who</a> season one for the library and have been previewing it. I&#8217;ll tell you right off that the show is bloody brilliant and we&#8217;re hooked.</p>
	<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/index.shtml">classic sci-fi show</a> was a staple on BBC from the 60s to the 80s. It was low budget camp, but affectionately good. They let it die a graceful death, but last year the BBC resurrect the series. I had heard that it was good&#8212;reruns have been showing on the <a href="http://www.scifi.com/doctorwho/">Sci-Fi Channel</a> But it is a lot better than I had expected. It&#8217;s close enough to the original that people will recognize the series, but it is so much better. It&#8217;s campy and humorous yet really great sci-fi. Highly recommended.</p>
	<h4>Equally brilliant&#8230;</h4>
	<p>...was Ned Lamont&#8217;s victory of Joe Lieberman. While I was glad to see Joe go down, there is more to the victory that I like. I like that candidates who are being outspent 2:1 and 3:1 are still winning. Jon Tester in Montana, Jim Webb in Virginia and now Ned Lamont in Conneticut all won against heavily financed opponents.</p>
	<p>Instead of winning through sheer expenditure of money they are winning by standing for something and organizing real people at the grassroots level. </p>
	<p>America needs to keeps its collective eye on this trend as it could corrupt our <em>current</em> system of government. It&#8217;s really beginning to smack of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/al16.html">a government of the people, by the people and for the people</a>. </p>
	<p>It&#8217;s truly a subversive concept.</p>

  	<p>The GOP just amazes me. They&#8217;re always wanting clean up or down votes on their issues, but they won&#8217;t give 15 million American workers a clean up or down vote on the minimum wage.</p>
	<p>No, instead they say <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/07/28/national/w130835D66.DTL&#38;type=politics">we&#8217;ll give you a couple of bucks in minimum wage, but only if you give multi-millionaires <strong>yet another</strong> juicy tax break</a> that will cost the nation $800 billion over the next decade when we are already drowning in red ink. </p>
	<p>Really graceful guys.</p>
	<p>Mind you, I&#8217;m not much more graceful today. </p>
	<p>It&#8217;s hard to describe, but I mount my bicycle on a moving start. Today, however, I didn&#8217;t realize the chain had come off and when I went to step on the peddle the bike offered no resistance or forward movement. Thus I flipped over the bike into the street just as an 18-wheeler was coming through the intersection.</p>
	<p>Other than a scraped knee and feeling sore I&#8217;m fine, but a truck (even one that is moving slowly as he saw me flip) is scary looking from asphalt level.</p>

  	<p>This is a <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com">sports car</a> I would love to own.</p>

	<p>The <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/20/tesla-roadster-unveiling-in-santa-monica/">Tesla Roadster</a>  does 0-60 in 4 seconds, top speed 130mph and&#8212;get this&#8212;zero emissions. </p>
	<p>It&#8217;s a high-performance electric car that you plug in at night. Full charge in 3.5 hours, 200 to 250 mile range, 135 miles per gallon equivalent, 1 cent a mile. Not bad at all, but this is what makes it <a href="http://wired.com/news/wiredmag/0,71414-0.html?tw=wn_index_1">drool worthy</a> ...</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>&#8220;You see any cops?&#8221; Eberhard asks, shooting me a mischievous look. The car is vibrating, ready to launch. I&#8217;m the first journalist to get a ride. He releases the brake and my head snaps back. <em>One-one-thousand</em>: I get a floating feeling, like going over the falls in a roller coaster. <em>Two-one-thousand</em>: The world tunnels, the trees blur. <em>Three-one-thousand</em>: We hit 60 miles per hour. Eberhard brakes. We&#8217;re at a standstill again&#8212;elapsed time, nine seconds. When potential buyers get a look at the vehicle this summer, it will be among the quickest production cars in the world.</p>
